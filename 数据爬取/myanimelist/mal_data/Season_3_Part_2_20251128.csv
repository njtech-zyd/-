lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2

However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography.

Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.

This arc was considered to be the best among the AOT fandom, which I completely agree. By now, anime-only watcher have witnessed the greatness of this series. Now, on to the review. Story 10/10: With the ever growing expansion of the universe within the AOT, anime-only watcher are invested on what in the basement since season 1( Manga reader are still divided within the community over the revelation. Personally, I love it). In this season, we see the three main MC return back to their homeland, ... Shiganshina, where the bloody battle will occur over securing the lost exterior in wall Maria( since season 1) . Character 8/10: Even though people might dislike the 3 main cast, I find them enjoyable. Eren is still hard-headed, but he is more stable compare to the previous season. Armin still use his brain on combating the enemy. Mikasa is still a badass( which is not a bad thing) Art/Sound 10/10: Wit studio amazing animation still impress me, still to these day. The OST, composed from Hiroyuki Sawano, never let me down. Conclusion: If you are a big fan of this series, you will find this season enjoyable.",Season_3_Part_2
jason022601,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Many people have anticipated the manga to be animated and when the wildfire spread all over the place in 2013, people were gushing over it. The popularity grew dramatically and along the way caused controversies as to whether it had become overrated. After watching the first 3 seasons, it is not. It never failed to deliver what Attack on Titan really is. So, what about this part of season 3? It still holds well. Whether you are a newcomer or a die-hard fan, you must admit that this is one of the best anime in a long time. Story - 10/10 The story in Attack on Titan ... was always deep and left many of us speculating what would happen next and came up with many theories. When I saw the first few episodes, I thought that the armored and colossal titans were simply evolved versions of the normal mindless titans or maybe the titan’s leaders or something. Over time, I was left heartbroken about the world in which the story takes place. This part of season 3 covers the return to shiganshina arc, and in my opinion is the most emotional arc of the entire story. Within these 10 episodes, there are many plot changes that leaves me more intrigued about future seasons. In short, this season shows us our heroes returning to the district where it all began, meeting familiar faces, and of course...learning the truth about the outside world as well as some backstory. Art - 10/10 The studio never fails to give us quality animation of our beloved characters and show us the beautiful scenery we were hoping to see in a long time. Certain moments are done especially well, such as Bertholdt's transformation into the colossal titan and Levi's fight against the Beast Titan. In scenes where characters are standing still for a couple of seconds, you can see how it is so like the manga (Mikasa's face as she wakes up in her cell makes her more beautiful than you can imagine). It is moments like this where people can admire the hard work that has gone into producing these wonderful episodes, and needless to say, while it does not retain its usual black outlining displayed in the first season...which I believed was a defining portion of the animation. It still gives us an example of how anime should be done these days. Sound - 9/10 Soundtrack is amazing as ever and all the tracks you will listen to this season is played at the right time for maximum experience, despite several scenes (Levi vs Beast Titan could have been better). I can't remember all the songs that are featured but they are nonetheless just as good if not better than the first several OST's. Hiroyuki Sawano delivers the best songs for the audience and the studio takes it even further by playing them for parts that make you feel the vibe you're suppose to feel. If an episode is going to be very sad, the opening will be cut and most of the soundtrack is absent. If the episode is going to feature a lot of fights and deaths, better pull out that song with a lot of powerful vocals. Ending theme is 10x better than the opening hands down! Voice acting is probably at its highest level. I know some characters such as Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, Erwin, and even Grisha have all received critical praise for their ability to convey the characters tone and message. Kaji Yuki and Hiroshi Kamiya are one of my favourite Seiyuu's out there. All the voice actors have always been able become the character and really let us feel what they are going through. Character - 10/10 Oh boy I believe this is the best part. We have seen what each character has done and how they act according to the situation. On top of that, OVA's and memories show us further what each person has experienced and how the titans changed their lives. Specific ones such as Armin, and Levi throughout this arc have really displayed what kind of person they've really become. Armin; We first initially saw him as just an ordinary boy, who had great hopes and dreams about the outside world. He has always been Eren and Mikasa's friend and over the years has shown us that he cares about them a lot. If either one of them is in trouble he would make no hesitation to help, although he would try in the least harmful way to avoid trouble for him as well. He has been a person who can act decisively and efficiently to prioritize his missions in the hopes that no one dies. Here we see him in a position of authority, leading the new survey corps into the district to reclaim the area under Erwin's command because he believes that Armin's intuition and mind are very useful. He was right, he was able to uncover the hiding spot of his enemies and come up with a plan to take bertholdt out under a lot of stress. Speaking of which, he is also able to make decisions if it came at a price. He was willing to risk his life for Eren and in turn, showed all of us that he isn't just some weak smart individual, but a strong, brave, and determined person. Levi; Much of us saw Levi as this superhuman who can kill almost any titan (thanks to his Ackerman heritage) and no matter how strong or abnormal the enemy is, he shows almost no emotion or hesitation and takes the fight with a lot of courage. Then again that was how we saw Levi for most of the time anyway. With the OVA's and part one of season 3, we have witnessed that Levi had a very rough upbringing, his childhood underground forcing him to fight for survival as well as his relationship with Erwin and Kenny inherently made Levi into a very proficient soldier. However, he is still able to lose it, the plan to take out the beast titan. This was a side of Levi that wasn't seen for quite a while. The position he was in and what he was supposed to do showed us his guilt and how much he was risking. It displayed a totally satisfying side of Levi, which is a reason why so many people love him. He feels the distraught of having to carry the burden midway through the season and had to move on from it quickly. Enjoyment - 9/10 This section will be a lot shorter. No doubt this will definitively grab your attention but, I feel as though this could've been 12 episodes as well, that would give an extra episode or two to fill up on the backstory. In one episode, the whole history of the people was rushed within about 10 minutes. Then the next we spend about two episodes with Grisha and Eren Kruger when really...both parts could have been about the same length. Overall - 10/10 Attack on titan is truly one of the best anime I have ever seen, although there are some flaws here and there, there is a guarantee that no matter how much experience you have with this show, you will most likely be on board...and hopefully like me, will be excited for the final season.",Season_3_Part_2
machixart,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*minor spoilers* What makes a classic? Something that represents quality. Something that is unique, but nostalgic. Something that you can revisit multiple times, and discover something new every. single. time. Is Attack on Titan the modern anime classic that we've all been seeking? Will it stand the test of time? Who knows and, in all honesty, who cares. To me, Attack on Titan is a classic because it is a masterpiece that's high-quality animation, storytelling, characters, and sound brings most works to shame, especially with Season 3 Part 2. This story started with a boy craving revenge against what seemed like humanity's greatest enemy: the titans who ... trashed his hometown. But Hajime Isayama has been trying to tell us this whole time that this story was something so much more complex than that. Are the titans really the enemy or are people their own enemies?  Part 2 of this season changes the pace of the whole story and gives us a whole new perspective on the titans. 'On that day, mankind received a grim reminder. We lived in fear of the Titans and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.' While the opening line of this series still stands true to every character, we now see what that means to each of them. What is means to Erwin, to Levi, to Eren, to Reiner and Bertholdt, even to random members of the Survey Corps. The line carries the emotions, hopes, dreams, and ambitions of every character in the series. We are able to easily follow the story and care for each of these characters because of how well the story was built up right from the start. This season was satisfying and exhilarating to many because of how all that built up suspense was released in a single episode with the revelation of the secret in the basement and Grisha's story. Every scene and episode rewards us with another piece of the puzzle. However, even with all the pieces we have been given, we continue to guess at what is to come. The writer balances suspense and anticipation perfectly with reward, and because of that, the series is crazy enjoyable. And do I even need to mention how perfectly the OSTs fit with each scene. Hiroyuki Sawano is a GOD and a master at sound tracks, but credit also goes to the studio for knowing exactly where to place every track and also where NOT to put music. Some scenes were perfect because of their lack of music which created a certain eeriness and made the scene seem more realistic. The art really completed the series. The Wit Studio's animation of Levi vs. the Beast Titan laughs in the face of every other studio's works and that is an irrefutable fact. Everything from the very birds and the sky to the hair on the titan's head displays the insane level of animation. I'm not great with words but holy shit its good. I don't even need to say anything. Is Attack on Titan a classic? Well it depends on your own definition of a classic. My score of 10 for this anime and this review don't even begin to show the impact this anime has had on the way I view every medium of art or the irreplaceable experience I've gained. Watch it and you tell me if its your classic, because it sure is mine.",Season_3_Part_2
PureEpicness,10,"Jun 9, 2019",0/0,"Ok after lurking for 27 years this anime's greatness has finally forced me to write my first review. As of writing this review i am at episode 18 midnight sun. Let me tell you that words cannot express how good this piece of art is as is evident by comparisons between the manga and anime with people saying it's 1000 times better in the anime. This 3rd season is above and beyond anything i have ever seen in anime and live action alike. It is so great that it can never be topped, only equaled. The phenomenally fleshed out characters are like your friends by now and you'll ... never see yourself more invested in their fate thus causing an unprecedented rollercoaster of emotions. All i can say is it's a great time to be alive to witness this and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on the quintessential spectacle of the century.",Season_3_Part_2
yenyenlee,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Don’t be so surprised when you see a whole stream of 10/10s come gushing from the reviewers who have just finished this piece of work. SnK Season 3 Part 2 is really, nothing short of breathtaking. It’s that one anime that actually makes you crave the next episode after the next, as the madman himself, Hajime Isayama leaves you awestruck with his storytelling. Why has such a typical looking shounen series risen to the 2nd place, in all of MyAnimeList? If you have not watched such a rare gem of this caliber (that may never appear in the next 5 years) yet, I suppose I ... should explain why. As I mentioned earlier, Isayama’s storytelling is perhaps one of the most stellar I have ever seen in the entirety of the anime industry. It is also one of the biggest factors that has made this season of SnK stand tall over the other anime in this Spring. SnK’s story up till now may seem like typical, “normie” shounen to the anime community, that is, PRIOR to this season. Giants invading our homeland, unexpected human betrayers, unexpected plot twists among human characters… what’s new? To be honest, nothing much up till the last season seems out of the ordinary, and may even be likened to shows outside of anime, such as The Walking Dead. You’re going to need a expert conman and a whole slew of lies to tell these non-SnK watchers otherwise, that this season is going to be exceptional. However! This is where Isayama’s narrative truly shines. In these 10 episodes. He pulls all the punches he has been holding in for the past 50 episodes and unleashes a good amount of plot twists in these 10. Golden. Just when you thought the action has died down, you realise that theres new plot twists and dilemmas at every turn. And of course, how could we forget? Eren’s basement. All the forgotten treats that Daddy Isayama has been saving up are all unleashed here! All the 50 episodes before these 10 were actually filled with masterful foreshadowing and allusions that you’ll never get, until it hits you all at once IN THESE 10 EPISODES. It’s amazing. I would give everything to rewatch these 10 and experience the tears and excitement that Daddy Isayama has prepared for us viewers. Its so rare to find a modern gem like this amongst all of the other seasonal anime that are shamelessly being broadcasted in this day and age. This 10-episode cour, shows us that SnK is not the typical, a villain a week shounen. (In fact, it is actually bordering towards seinen at this rate.) Every fight in the RTS arc feels like a matter of life and death, as it remains unknown till the very end which side is going to emerge as the victor. With that being said, who even is the good side? With both sides having such a strong rationale as to why they fight for their side, they can only attribute it to the cruelty of this world we live in, that forces both sides to fight against each other (In fact, Bertholdt spoke about this beautifully in the show). Such strong reasons to fight in both the good and the bad sides allow us to sympathise with both sides during the fight, making every clash of fists and blades such a spectacle to behold. Many of the major characters in the show are all being developed beautifully and have such wholesome characters. Ironically though, the least polished characters happen to be the always-angry-and-screaming Eren and the Mary Sue that is Mikasa. I don’t mind though, because the story was never centered on their development anyway, it is rather the discovery of the world’s lore and their fates, not so much their person. Anyway, Kaji Yuki and Yui Ishikawa were awesome portraying their lines! So I’m cool with those 2 characters. This show however, doesn’t just develop their characters by showing you some cheesy dialogue and some cheap backstory. They make the characters earn it from us. Levi has shown us that he’s a self-sufficient being who takes all the sh*t that the cast throws at him, which may very well sabotage the future of their people. He does everything without complaint, and masterfully tries to take the objective. Armin and Erwin have both shown their mastery on the battlefield, and gets any job done without the show having to pull any Deus Ex Machinas in a seemingly hopeless fight. The characters never fail to impress me with their lines and actions. They’re well thought out and well fleshed out. Isayama is such a genius. I love him so much. And of course, how could we forget? Looking at all of the personnel who were involved in the production of this anime, you could tell that it was staged for success. Sawano Hiroyuki doing the music, Kamiya Hiroshi doing Levi, Daisuke Ono doing Erwin (every jojo fan’s wet dream), Kaji Yuki and Park Romi, and many others.  This is literally a production team’s dream team, and the final work was indeed such a spectacle to behold. WIT studio’s animation was so fluid and every motion of the fight scenes were literally works of art. I could go on. It’s that marvellous. Anyway, for those who have not been following this show, now is a good time to start. Please, don’t get spoiled before you even start the series, especially about anything regarding these 10, legendary episodes. You’re missing out on a rare gem.",Season_3_Part_2
PunkyBoyGWiz,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I feel like ever since the early 2000s I've been waiting for a true masterpiece to rival all the great anime like FMA: Brotherhood and Code Geass and I think I have finally found that show. There have been a lot of good shows since back then but Attack on Titan clearly 100% stands on top as the best! Anyone can tell the man that created this show is very intelligent this is the work of a creative genius. I usually have trouble watching shows with a lot of dialogue because most of them don't have real substance like Attack on Titan. I think the ... most special aspect of this show is that every discussion has meaning, every scene has a purpose whether it's visually showing you something or what you're listening to, that is proof of a true work of art! I don't even know what to call this it feels like an insult just calling this a TV show this is more than that. Anyone that wants to create a story or be in show business should study this season of Attack on Titan. Every single scene is important to the story and what a story it's turning into. I almost couldn't believe what I was watching at some points it's like a mix between the best sci-fi anime like Steins Gate and the best action anime like in Dragon Ball or Naruto. Everything you could want in a show is woven perfectly together to create this beautiful anime. By the way I suggest not reading the manga at this point, I see a lot of comments of people that have never read it saying I'm going to read the manga but there's no way the manga tops this show!

Arjuna777,10,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"When last year Season 3 was declared to be split cour there was a considerable sadness among the fans because of the delay.But it actually came as a blessing in disguise.This season had probably the highest anticipation till now and it goes without saying there was lot of expectation and honestly WIT Studio was able to deliver it.Whether they will pick up SNK again or not is not clear at this point but this season will probably be their best work for a long time. Contains Spoilers Story-10/10 The story picks up from season 3 part 1 where the SC sets off to liberate Wall Maria and ... to know what is in the Basement,On the surface it may appear very simple but constant plot twists and thriller like environment completely blows away your mind.The story flowed in a smooth manner and never once do you feel bored.Even the parts that the anime added and which was not in the manga fits well enough that you won't feel it being added at all.All the foreshadowings that we saw in previous seasons becomes quite clear in this season,and you will be left wondering that even the smallest hints actually pointed to a larger picture.Another point i will like to focus on how well they portrayed war can be like we see in real life.War is not here idealistic,it is not to gain some achievements or Medals in battle but it is a battle for survival and the story drives this point home.And when you finish the story you will have a feeling of satisfaction at the ending. Art-8/10 WIT studio did a fabulous job in this field.The art style of the manga has been improved tremendously,especially the battle scenes which are brought to life.Though there are few scenes where the animation looks mediocre but more or less the story and the animation here fits well.Though there is one part which i didn't like and that is the CGI Colossal Titan,It looks bad and it is a downgrading from the first season but we don't see it too much so it can be ignored.So overall i can't give it perfect score in this category. Sound-10/10 The Sound and music and always been the strength of Attack on Titan Anime and this season manages to maintain it,the opening song was nicely done along with ED.The background music perfectly brings out the atmosphere of the story,at times when the music plays it feels as if the music itself is telling the story.Special thanks to Sawano for this performance.Also the seiyuu's did a great job and really brought their emotions while voicing their respective characters. Characters-10/10 This season had probably the best character development till now.The characters don't appear simply organic,rather they look human like and we see our own reflections upon them.The main characters like Eren and Mikasa show their fear,determination and even their dark sides while facing adverse circumstances.Armin rose to show his determination and his beliefs that it nearly brings tears in your eyes.Bertolt is another character who showed his maturity and character development that you are bound to praise him.But the real man in this show is definitely Erwin.Whatever might be his role in the previous seasons this time his character development is legendary,his guilt,his determination and his courage was amazingly portrayed.The way he instigated the scouts in a suicidal strike it will remain in our mind for a long time.Even minor characters like Floch has their moments too. Enjoyment-10/10 This season is the best season till now according to my opinion,i feel this is one of the greatest works i saw in quite a while,I don' know if the fourth season will surpass it but for now this will remain in my mind for a long time,i will probably watch it soon enough to enjoy it while binge watching. So i suggest everyone to try it,you didn't like previous seasons that much,doesn't matter you may like this quite well.You will glue yourself to the screen and will not be able to move until you finish the anime.",Season_3_Part_2
poemofdevil,10,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"A lot of bombs dropped this second half of the season. The story has finally kicked into high gear. Twists and turns and revelations seemingly dropped every episode. The plot moved beyond the threat of regular titans to the threat of the true enemy outside of the walls. We're finally starting to understand who Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, and Zeke are. The society they belong to, where they are coming coming from, the reasons behind the attacks, and the titan origin story are some of the questions that answers were given to.

Mrromana,10,"May 27, 2019",0/0,"Let me just start by saying that I am kind of an AOT fanboy, but I'll try to be as unbiased as possible. This season (or half season) of AOT has been everything a fan of the show could possibly ask for. Dare I say, it almost makes up for all the delays we've had between the 2 halves of the season. If we’re going to get quality content like that then it’s absolutely worth the wait. Opening: 8/10 Stunning visuals as usual, the return of Linked Horizon is certainly a welcome one, even though the song is a shameless mash up of all the previous openings, I ... still loved it and have never skipped it. Although it was a weird choice to include so many spoilers in it, I guess the staff was just that proud of their animation. (Not in my top 2 Ops though) Animation: 10/10 Maybe one of the best aspects about this season, there were some amazing sequences with the ODM, maybe the best in the entire show (which is saying a lot especially after that Levi sequence at the beginning of season 3), the Colossal titan has always divided opinion but honestly I was never really too bothered with the CGI, but I was happy to see they put some 2D transitions whenever they could with him in some shots, it was a nice call back to the OG Colossal from season 1. There is a specific scene that stands out to me during the rock throwing, where the atmosphere slowly gets filled with a red mist during all the carnage. It really added a lot to the crushing and terrifying atmosphere they faced, and a very impressive attention to detail. Sound: 9/10 I mean is it really surprising to anyone how good the soundtrack is? A couple of slightly changed versions of the very popular OST from seasons 1 and 2 did the trick for most of the scenes. Although I was a tiny bit disappointed there is not really any new ones, I guess when the old ones are that good you don’t have to constantly change it. Plot/Characters: 10/10 This is really where the story of AOT matures a lot, and develops from just a zombie survival story with a couple of cool monster fights into something much more compelling. I really loved the character development that Bertholt finally had, it really was long overdue.  Erwin’s speech was just glorious (both writing and voice acting). To sum up, this season has been the best anime I’ve watched in recent memory, and as a manga reader I’m just so excited to see if future seasons match this one in quality. I definitely have faith though.",Season_3_Part_2
-Mullerio-,6,"May 24, 2019",0/0,"One of the most hyped shows this year....yea, but it still has its flaws that even the craziest Big man fights can't hide. SPOILERS for everything up to Season 3 Episode 12/Season 3 first half Art: The Art style this Season changed quite a bit, by that i mean how the whole show is drawn is way closer to the art style of the Manga than in previous Season wich is good. The overall animation is good most of the time, but a big no no for the art part is that it tells its story not with visuals and instead relying on dia/monologue to explain every bit of ... information. Sound: The voice Acting is pretty good for most of the Characters,but a big fail for this Series is the shallow dialogue they explain tactics way to often and some of the dialogue just explains the things every Human with a functioning brain can see. As for the music wich always was a strong point in SnK its still pretty good, but the new OP is not as amazing as every OP prior to it, the ending is fine i guess. Story: It's Return to Shiganshina time...this follows the probably best action arc so far in the anime, the Story was always a strong point in the series but after this Season the story will get even better and because of this i turned into a SnK Manga fan. This Season is bascially the turning point, but as i said its just the turning point, it builds of brilliantly but all those 3 Season of build up, the story was fine just fine. Characters: There you go, this is the point where SnK always had its problems and this Season still has those. The main Characters wich should be the ""stronger"" or more developted Charcaters in the series fall flat. In a Nutshell Eren developed from ""i will win"" to ""we will win"".Mikasa is still just ""EREN"" ""EREN"".Armin is the only one of the 3 that actually is a well developted Character, he is the generic Shounen third wheel Character trope, but what makes him stand out among other Characters of this trope is his development and that it wasn't in the span of 1 episode and instead the development of his Character had his ups and downs but in the end he actually found something to not feel useless about. The series also had some problems with being based on shock factor, in Season 1 they killed some Characters who no one cared about....in this Season nothing Changed some Characters will die who no one cared about, just to show us ""oh yea its dangerous"". As for the rest of the cast, most Characters are Mediocre they miss much development but some still have some points speaking for them.Jean is generic but how he reacts on the Titans seems pretty realistic, its the same with Connie both of them are basically our view on the world because they react in a way most Humans would react if they would see a Titan eating some Humans, despite this Connie is a Character with near to 0 development, the rest of the side cast is similar with every Character having one or 2 good points and 1 or 2 bad points.Reiner and Berthold are both similar Characters that i cant really judge without spoiling Manga things.The one that stands out is Erwin, he is a Character that on the surface is just ""SHINZOU WO SASAGEYO"" but at his core Erwin is a Charatcer that HAS A DREAM and will do everything to acquire it. Final verdict: This was a very superficial Review, but in the end not much changed with this series its still a enjoyable show with some bigger flaws, maybe the show will improve in Season 4 with the new revelations happening in this Season but prior to that its a enjoyable show with a decent story muddled by mediocre Characters. 5.7/10 If you wanna discuss some points i made or just hate this review feel free to shitpost on my profile, the one last point i wanna make is that every anime only that doesnt read the Manga after this Season needs to be a real bad masochist.",Season_3_Part_2

farhanridom,10,"Oct 22, 2024",0/0,"I don’t care what people says. I love unpredictable shows. And AoT was just creative in every way. The ending is also best suited for this show. And this is the first anime that made me realize that animes can also have good stuff too(Sorry if it sounds humiliating). And who are these crybabies rating it 1 star and saying 3000 words of nonsense talk. 🙄Spoiler ahead from Season 1 Episode 1 only The thing I love the most about AoT is the multidimensionality of its mass cast, By mass cast I meant the characters who have like 1 min of screentime still has multi dimensional ... psychology which enhances the realism of the Series. I want to breakdown one for you guys. It is about Eren's mom. The moment in ep 1 of AOT, Carla telling Hannes to run away with Eren and Mikasa, but then breaking down and pleading “Don’t go” is a perfect example of the realistic, multidimensional psychology that even minor characters exhibit in AoT. In episode 1, after Carla's legs are crushed, she selflessly urges Hannes to save Eren and Mikasa, embodying maternal sacrifice. But then, almost immediately after making that selfless decision, Carla breaks down and says, “Don’t go.” This moment of hesitation is deeply human—it reflects the conflicting emotions of someone who is fully aware that they are about to die but still has a powerful, instinctual desire to live. She doesnt want to die. No matter how noble or selfless someone might try to be, the will to survive often kicks in while facing death. In her heart, Carla knows she’s sacrificing herself, but her fear and desire to hold on to life briefly overpower her. wanting to save her children, but also feeling an overwhelming fear of being left behind to face death is what makes her feel like a real, fleshed-out character despite her limited screen time. It reminds the audience that behind every character in the series, major or minor, there’s a real person with fears, desires, guiltiness, hatred, and many other emotions. Carla’s character, while having little screen time, embodies the multidimensionality of characters. Her actions and emotions reflect a deep understanding of human psychology, showing that even characters who seem ""insignificant"" has significant amount of realism and psychological complexity. And there are hundreds scenes like that where 1 or 2 dialogues make a insignificant character so realistic which portrays The nature of human perfectly.",Season_3_Part_2
pussyeater2000,1,"Sep 13, 2020",0/0,"I want to first note that I did enjoy season 3 part 2. I'm a big fan of the show. If you turn off your brain, ignore the pacing issues, and writing, you will find a lot of enjoyment in the show. That is the case for me. However, I think that for the most part, making me feel suspense and a rush of emotions at every single moment, isn't a sound approach necessarily. If there is anything that irks me most, it is the conclusion to part 2. The veil of mystery over the entire world suddenly dissipated. That is an appeal in the show, the ... fact that we are in this isolated world with so much mystery and uncertainty. It seems that everything around you is shedding slowly, but only ever so slowly. The fact that this entire shroud of mystery that is built up since the very beginning is dissipated so instantly through the revelations at the end of the season, concerns me. It doesn't sit right, especially with the tone and atmosphere of the show. Regardless, great entertainment, but nothing to note further.",Season_3_Part_2
IWannaMuffin,9,"May 21, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan what can i say an iconic show that everyone knows about and most people like, has finally gotten the 2nd part of its 3rd season after about 7 months of the 1st part finishing. I cannot lie about being disappointed that there are only 10 episodes this season however if they keep up the quality that they have now then the show will be one of the best shows to have been created in a while. Anyway now for my opinions on the each individual part of the show. -Story- Well if you are a long time watcher of attack on titan you probably know ... why this is rated as highly as it is, at least in my opinion, as the story always manages to draw me in and keep me there because of the ever twisting plot that coils around itself and makes the show somewhat unpredictable (unless you have read the manga). -Art- Well it was licensed by Funimation and animated by Wit Studio, who have produced shows such as 'After the Rain' and 'The Ancient Magus' Bride' which were both stunning shows visually so you don't have to be worried about the art style being different as a 1 punch man season 2 did not happen here. -Sound- Again what else can i say except that the OSTs and Openings fit the show perfectly (except for Op4 which was the one from the 1st part of season 3 which i really didn't like). However one more thing i will say about the OP is that it reminds me a lot of the 1st and 3rd Ops which were by far the best (in my opinion). -Character- The characters are the same interesting bunch we have been thankfully stuck with for all this time, however i will say that characters such as Bertolt and Reiner have become significantly more interesting especially in the 3rd episode when you discover that they may want exactly what they are trying to achieve. -Enjoyment- Now for the only stat that truly matters my own personal enjoyment whilst watching the show and honestly if the fights and animation stay this good for the rest of the season then i will most likely give this a 10 as I've not had this much fun watching a serious anime in a long time as everything about the show keeps me on edge, however the god damn cliff hangers make me feel on edge permanently whilst the show is airing which i do not like. -Overall- If you haven't watched Attack on titan or are sceptical if you should watch it, I am gonna say you absolutely must even if you wait for the show to finish airing 1st and if you haven't seen any of attack on titan then slap it on your plan to watch and get around to it sometime soon as you will not regret it.",Season_3_Part_2
chair-sama,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Avengers Endgame was the biggest cinematic event this year. It was a conclusion of a 10 year worth storytelling, ended in the form of a big bombastic battle, the battle to revive all of the people who died during a Thanos’s snap. You should realise why I’m making this comparison, because, we also got another big bombastic battle in the 2nd part of the 3rd season of Attack on Titan. It was about retaking, what was stolen from humanity, in the first episode of the series, the Wall Maria, and now after the 6 years of waiting we're finally seeing the battle to get it ... back. But not only that, but we’re also getting the answer to the biggest mystery in the series: What are the titans, and what exactly is in the basement? *mild spoiler warning* The plot In this season is a little bit slow, because most of it revolves around the fights inside, and outside of the wall, but it feels like so many things are happening at ones, along with rising tension, and anticipation, with every new episode. Plans and strategies from both sides are constantly changing, what makes extremely intersesting to see what will be they're next move, and how will this adapt in the fights, which are by the way amazing. It’s like watching a game of 4D chess on a big screen, while riding a rollercoaster. After the big battle, there’s a few episodes of answering the most important questions in the series, and on the season final we get to see Armin’s dream come true. There’s actually not many things I can find in this seasons plot, to lower the score. Excluding the overall slow pace, it’s really amazing story, and we should appreciate it. The character development achieves its peak in this season. Erwin realises, that a single man’s dream means nothing in the scale of war, so he leads his army to suicide battle with Beast Titan. Berthold, and Armin getting through their shyness, where the first unlocks the strength, hidden in the TRUE POWER OF LOVE! And the second, finally shines with his genius mind to strategies, and sacrifices evereything he has, for the sake of the mission. Joan still believes in the possibile redemption for others *heh, forshadowing*. Oh, and also Ymir is officially a lesbian *..........Woohoo!*. The animation still looks gorgeous, through it's most part, but damn what happened to Colossal Titan? His legs are so wide! He looks awfull! Sawano Hirayuki again makes a great work. The beautifull music  hit us hard in the emotional moments, and dubstep, and rock versions adds a tension when it’s action. This man is a pure genius, along with Linked Horizon, who in my opinion made the best opening so far. Shoukei no Shikobane Michi creates so much hype at the start of the episode. Ending song is pretty good too. Also I love the moment in the op, when whole opening is rewinding itself, and it ends on the picture of basement, as of the hole story came back to the starting point. How can anybody not enjoy the anime version of Endgame? It was definitelly the best season so far, and arguably the best anime we’ve got. It was a wild ride, and I can’t wait for another season.

SherifGharib,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Lets Make It The Top Anime On The Website Attack on Titan is the most influecial anime of the last decade! First, let me preface this review with I'm an absolute AOT fanboy. It's my second favourite anime of all time; My favourite is FMA B. However I think the best method of pushing Attack on Titan to new heights is too hopefully be very critical. Animation: This is definitely the most polarising part of this season (Colossal titan). But I wanna start with the positive parts first. The ODM gear animation is some of my favourite animation period. It really allows the animators to create something dynamic and ... thrilling, because of it's 3D style. In my opinion, it really helps to add scale to not just the surrounding, but the Titans as well. Lets not even get into the dopamine rush I get when Levi ""swings by"". As far as this animation goes this season, I'd say it's very much on the level of part 1 (incredible). Even tho there hasn't been as much on display. So next to the Titan side of the animation. First, Reiner and Eren's Titans both of which are better or at least on par with previous seasons. So essentially very good at minimum. As far as their fight goes I'd say it was better than any previous season Titan vs Titan fight. I think the only thing that held it back was just the pacing of it, at times movement was slowed to create a ""dramatic effect"". I would have been fine with this if it was only done once. That's the only criticism I have for that fight, so I excluding that I thought the fight was stunning. Now on to the ""colossal fuck up"". Haha, see what I did there. This CGI isn't good. Anyone that defends this Roblox's titan, just know that you're not pushing AOT up. Your anchoring it down. While it isn't as bad some people make it out to be (me). Considering AOT is by far the most substantial anime of the last decade. It should be held up to a higher standard of animation. To conclude I think the animation so far is a strong 8/10. Plot / Charaters: So far we haven't exactly had many touching moments with any charters, but that's for the most part, is because of the hyped nature of this arc. The most substantial character moment so far wasn't massive for me as it is featured in an ova. But with that being said the plot is nothing less than exhilarating. They really did decide to jump in head first. My eyes are literally glued to the screen, I can't take my eyes off. Personally, I love shows that build a great foundation in earlier seasons and then pick up the pace later on. Which is exactly what they've done so far. Another thing I love about this arc is the emphasis that is put on the tactical aspect. Erwin and Armin are by far the tacticians of the year. I must admit though it is nice to see Armin get that screen time. We are defiantly moving towards a big reveal. I can't wait to find out what's in that basement God dayum. To conclude so far this is one of my favorite arcs of the entire show. 9.9/10 Intro: Two words: Absolute Tune. 10/10 To conclude these last 4 episodes are some of the greatest anime I've ever seen. This show has already carved itself into history. So let's just hope they fixed the CGI in the upcoming episodes. If that is done, this could become one of the best seasons of anime ever to hit the screen. Overall Rating 9.5/10 Thanks for reading!!",Season_3_Part_2

marshrandy24,10,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"*This review may have some minor spoilers* This season's work has forced me to pen down my first review on MAL. Also this review is from a point of view of a person who hasn't read the manga but only watched the anime. The chronological buildup from season 1 to season 3 part 1 had hyped up the latter part of season 3. And I think it was a very wise decision from the studio to divide the season 3 into 2 parts. Just like major arcs of movies are divided into two parts to provide depth and emphasis of the things to come. The crux of 3rd ... season dealt with what I call is the Royal bloodline Arc(S03 Part 1) and the shiganshina arc Story: 10/10 Well, the way the S03 partv1 went I had lowered my expectation for part 2 even though i felt hyped up. The slow paced arc concentrating more on the humanly battles and political shift made it a little stale, and to be honest, I didn't know the importance of that arc till the time I went more than a halfway part 2. Unlike the part 1 we get a fast paced storyline, various character arcs going through twists and turns. Fascinatingly this time, the psychological warfare between Eren and Co vs Beast titan and Co was quite strongly depicted. The strategic build up, victories and defeats (in parts) were quite the cliffhangers at the end of each episode making you wonder what will happen next. The major twist that came after the episode of the basement started laying the ground for upcoming season 4 and a new arc while the final episode of the season left us wanting more but one could also say it was a calm and subtle end to one great arc. Art : 9/10 Looking at the structure and depiction of titans few questions will arise in your mind but be patient, everything is depicted in a way for a certain reason. I would say the animation was a lot better than any of the previous seasons and if one wants to look deeper into the animation of the characters and surroundings they can find subtle hints of the surroundings. (or maybe it's just me cause return to shiganshina is a little nostalgic) Sound : 10/10 I was unimpressed by the opening theme, it just felt like it didn't have the same gravity like other opening themes of previous seasons. Now putting that aside the soundtrack used in this season was absolutely mind-blowing. The way Hiroyuki Sawano inserted the score at the key points of arcs that the effect of the soundtrack combined with the animation quadrupled the emotional and mental effect on the viewers. I felt hooked throughout each episode. Even the ending theme (god what a graceful theme) is just faded in so beautifully in each episode. The way Hiroyuki Sawano works, well god bless him to give us such soundtracks more and more. Character: 9/10 I feel some character arcs had a pretty good overall development over this season. One can say it was almost perfect. though I was a little distraught that they gave Eren Kruger quite a little show in the last few episodes. I would have preferred to explore his background a little more and hope they do include that in season 4. WE see survey corp members go through psychological trauma in middle of their battles and witness the end of some characters as well which was well crafted to give them a perfect ending Enjoyment: 10/10. I totally enjoyed this season. Because of the above mentioned reasons, i felt hooked till the end of each episode and wished if it could go for one more hour. Overall: 10/10 This season was the best in AOT's history so far. A masterclass season that made my heart go awry after the sick and bad ending to Game of Thrones this summer. Hope you found this review helpful",Season_3_Part_2

YoohanBT,10,"Jul 3, 2019",0/0,"Well, what else to say? I know some might think people get hyped too quickly and don't judge one story in a neutral state, but this is beyond that. I've been waiting for this point of the anime since I've read the manga, and since no one was talking about it, I couldn't believe how good it was, now I had a closure about that doubt. For me, what makes an artwork good is how strings are built around the plot and the bases of it. Iconically, and for those who watched the whole part 2, the ""paths"" we knew about are ... one of the features that takes the AoT to the next level, and it ties with my first point. Moreover, most of the mysterious points and that aspect of how every detail counts add this bite of epicness and ""holliness"" around the show... To state it short, Attack on titan will remain, for me, simply one of the greatest shows I've ever had the chance to witness, and to miss it is to miss something near to absolute greatness or objective masterpiece, so far (since no one knows how it will end yet).",Season_3_Part_2

With the final season airing next year things will only get better and I couldn't be more exicted for season 4. The theme of freedom has been one of the more prominent ones in the show but with the last episode, our main character Eren questions the morality of freedom and whether he can achieve it. This season will determine the ... future greatness about to come, the pacing, the animation, the voice acting, the plot were all executued perfectly in this season.

LegendAqua,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"5 Years and 4 seasons in and FINALLY we get see what is in Eren's basement....we just need to get through an intense battle with some titans. If the first part of Season 3 was about the political upheaval and the human villains, then Part 2 is about the titan villains and the secret that Shingeki no Kyojin has kept for soo long.....and man was it worth it. First thing is first, Part 2 goes straight into the action where Eren and co. fight against the Colossal, Beast and Armoured Titan and what the bulk of this Part 2 focuses on, Battle of Wall Maria and ALOT ... of shit happens... Part 2 does give many highlights, but Part 2 seems dedicate ALOT of time which was much needed to Armin and Erwin, the main strategists of the human side, while giving Bertholt and Reiner on the ""villains"" side. To say that Erwin and Armin has precedence in this season is an understatement, from Erwin and Armin giving their all, not only in strategies but in their characters, both in their ideologies in the heat of battles have been heightened and dramatically and emotionally climaxed (no seriously) in this season. Heck even Erwin and Armin are put into comparison because they are soo crucial, instrumental and valuable to the cause of humanity. But yeah Erwin and Armin gets MASSIVE amount of screentime, character development and was well done all things considered. Bertholt and Reiner does get development being the major focal villains of the season as well as the Beast Titan, but if anything both Bertholt and Reiner seen in a villainous sympathetic light, kinda makes sense as they were friends, but turned villains against humanity with their own reasons, just never told to us, nonetheless having that makes the fights all the more intense and somewhat emotional in a ways. The animation done once again by Wit Studio is just amazing as per usual and with the fight being soo intense and well animated, LA has nothing but praise from Wit Studio for having the consistency and crazily well done, intense and atmospheric fights and with the majority of this season being NOTHING BUT...yeah. The voice cast is obviously back, but LA will say some major props to Marina Inoue as Armin, Daisuke Ono as Erwin, Hiroshi Kamiya as Levi, Tomohisa Hashizume as Bertholt and Yoshimasa Hosoya as Reiner. Really not much to say...wait Takehito Koyasu voiced Beast Titan..as in DIO...ok perfect voice cast..saying it right there. Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 was ultimately the culmination of the secrets of Eren's basement as well as the characters fighting to both stop and or get to that basement and it was glorious. Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 was also probably LA's favorite anime for Spring 2019 and to be honest can you blame LA?, LA like you have been wanting to know want was in Eren's basement ever since the anime started and we FINALLY DO...

sashimiso,10,"Oct 16, 2019",0/0,"Nowadays I see a lot of people writing off AOT, and I think it's a real shame. AOT has come an incredibly long way, and the way I see it, the next season will be even better. The first season was all about shock value, gore, and the paaaaaaACING was not consistent. It was still enjoyable. Season 2 and Season 3 introduce many new and intriguing facets and really forces you to think about the brutal realities of war, death, duty, and perseverance. There's no plot armor, but there is no mindless death. It all feels real. Every single situation is brutal and the choices each ... character must make is hard, but realistic. Throughout the show, I did not know what I would do should I be placed in those circumstances, and it made me feel for the characters all the more. I could not guess what was coming next, and my mind was constantly in a state of disarray. Eren might be the main character, but these past two seasons have pulled many other characters to the spotlight and they   S H I N E D. It made it seem like everyone had a story, everyone could be the main character. If you'd like some great visuals accompanied by a humorous but frank review of AOT and its new seasons, then you should watch Gigguk's latest video ""Attack on Titan is Incredible Now"". I think he does a great job of breaking it down simply and a matter-of-factly. Give it a go! Don't be a hater just because it's ""overrated"" and  AOT was super hyped. I think that's a very naive viewpoint because I genuinely appreciate how far it has come.",Season_3_Part_2
Legendz-Senpai,10,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"*Spoiler Review* I'm not a fan of Snk (more than before now) but I liked to watch the anime because it's a quality job, except that since the release of season 3, part 2, I really understood what Snk is ... You do not have to be a fan to understand that this adaptation is probably part of the best manga adaptation of the last 10 years . To say that it's just an anime action is really badly know the ... work and the problems it raises . After all  revelations if you return look at the previous seasons you will have the right to a new way of seeing things in the universe of SNK and you will understand why finally the author is really a genius. Story 10/10 : Breathtaking and surprising story especially if you have not read the manga it opens up really interesting possibilities for the manga when you do not know more in addition to that it's really well explained and there is a lot of historical reference that gives a lot of background to the story. The path of the episode 7 is maybe a little long but it is so exiting because are finally the revelation that everybody waits  and even flashbacks are really very interesting. Sacrifice, courage and death for one's homeland are the central elements of this part which personally I liked a lot. Sound 10/10 : Exceptional music that fits perfectly with the atmosphere even the opening and the ending really sticks to the mood of the season.once again Linked Horizon managed to make a very good opening obviously less striking than any other but still good and Sawano is really out of category he really transforms some scene: Erwin's Charge Theme and The Owl Theme. Character 10/10 : Character really well written and better transcribed in anime Erwin typically is probably the most underside character of snk but yet he's really great in this season it's also him who really makes me love this season. There is really a change of character in some characters between the beginning and the end of the season and you see that the disappearance of some character completely upset the characters. Then there is also an ethical choice that is really well transposed into anime Erwin or Armin. There are good reasons to choose Erwin as there are good reasons to choose Armin they are also explain clearly but in the end what I find the most beautiful is that it is Erwin himself who chose for everyone with his hands and Livai who seems really sad so far he remains strong. Studio 9/10 :  Is not content to resume the manga but the completely sublimated it's very rare and pausing between different parts of the adaptation is really a good idea and gives more chance to have a good animation like here so yes it's not the best animation in the world I agree but it is so efficient when it has to be (Livai moment) (Berthold Transformation) Once again congratulations and I hope not to see a change of studio for the rest of the anime because for me Snk is sublimated by Wit Studio. To conclude I think that after this adaptation I understand perfectly why I like Japanese animation and why after so much anime to watch I still love so much. In the end we can even be surprised even in 2019 may be that the continuation of the anime will be less good etc ... but in any case this part is the most successful until now.",Season_3_Part_2
Guju_Chan,10,"Mar 26, 2023",0/0,"Hands down the best season of the series and one of the best arcs ever made. The characters aren't perfect, but they are just so real; not one dimensional like the usual manga/anime stories. There are so many emotions involved with every character whether living or dead, in both sides, with their individuality, dreams, selfishness, sacrifices, strengths & weaknesses, they all feel so real and raw. The plot and characters deserve 1000 on 10. Animation and Music is decent as well. AOT is very well written, probably a bit too well written at times that it goes over so ... many peoples head at times. Just enjoy this masterpiece in all its glory. Clearly one of the greatest stories ever created. Don't let anyone convince you anything otherwise.",Season_3_Part_2

Attack on titan adapts to its quick character arcs and development without deviating from the base plot , the cliffhangers left me in a state of awe whereas the emotional scenes were subtle and on point hitting right into the feels. As a whole Attack on titan  season 3 part 2 was phenomenal and brilliantly made. Story : 10 the main soul of this season was the story , it did not lack or deviate from its origins anywhere which made it easier for the audience to connect faster Art : 9 ... Attack on titan has one of the best arts of all time , there isn't a minute where the art felt lacking lustre to it Character : 9 the character development grew out be much more real and authentic in this season by not just following a random goal or weird perception (LEVI CHARACTER WAS OP) Enjoyment : 10 this season has everything attack on titan fans had been waiting for,  be it emotion,action,story everything was a complete package",Season_3_Part_2
MainstreamBean,6,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Firstly, before reading this, note again that my rating is not a 10 out of 10. No, I'm not a huge fan of the show, but I also don't completely hate on it just for the sake of doing so due to popularity. No, I do not think this arc of AOT is a masterpiece, nor do I think the series as a whole is, and far from it. However, I do think this part of the series holds some merit regardless. After the mess that I had witnessed, being the third season (mostly being comprised of political bullshit and ... story elements I was convinced to care about), a second part continuing on where it had left off was announced, albeit I was reluctant to continue on by that point. Thankfully though, I can pretty confidently say that the first half of this part puts to shame the boredom and lack of engagement I had previously. Essentially, without getting into any spoilers, our main cast is assigned to retake a district, and reach Eren's basement. From then on, we follow our crew, along with the Survey Cops in order to fulfill this goal. Through some great action, cliff hangers, and good pacing, twist and turns are met, as multiple characters are put through tough situations, leading to internal motivations and conflicts being resolved in commendable ways. Combined with some nice directing, there are more than a few shining moments during these episodes. The art (other than the CG titan and horses) and soundtrack still remained consistent with its previous seasons, with no downgrade in quality. In short, the first half was enjoyable at the very least. However, I can't comment and praise as much for the second half. Most of what I don't necessarily care for in AOT would be in the character drama and backstories department. Much of what made up the third season was this, pertaining to the government and a hidden past. Hence, it is the same here, just minus the government part. Admittedly, it's not as a drag as it was for the previous attempt in the first part of season 3, though it just that in the end. It all feels sort of generic in the way that I could only describe as average. It almost feels like this show does it for the sake of doing it, almost like it feels like it has to. The main cast still feels underwhelming and sort of bland to me, despite the time spent with them. I never watched AOT initially in order to scheme across and discover a whole story of lore about what made this series up, more or less just to experience it and entertain myself with what was being presented. Sure its had mysterious elements, but those elements are treated as though since they exist, everything else must be explained, regardless of what it is, almost to create a feeling of a ""fleshed out story"".  I know it's totally understandable for fans to find such backstories essential or engaging, and that's absolutely fine, but for me personally, they just hold no merit. They don't add any enjoyment for me to the series. (This may also be true for the fact that the mystery of Eren's basement as dragged on so for long, and I don't care for politics and government anyways, especially in a world run by man-eating titans). Overall, this part was a huge improvement over what I was delivered last year. Although I do find many elements of this part of the show in this arc commendable and appreciative, and for the same token a drag and a bit of nuance to my enjoyment, it still just remains the ever popular show to have come out in 2013. I haven't suddenly deeply cared for, nor felt for the cast of characters or whole backstory of the plot as I did from the first season, but I can still see the improvement this show has made for fans of it. I only write this review to propose a view from someone who isn't a massive fan of the show, or one not willing to give it a tremendously high score. Again, I don't entirely dislike this show, and in fact, I gave the first season and this one an above average score. I just don't seem to share the same sentiment many others do for it, but then again, we all have different tastes.",Season_3_Part_2
DoomNick,4,"Jan 22, 2020",0/0,"(Review of the series thus far.) Let me get something straight. I will be watching season 4, And not ironically either, I'm genuinly curious as to how it'll turn out and gave story and art some pretty good scores despite the visual quality of the animation as a standard dropping heavilt, Let me explain. Now, For less critical individuals who can still identify as intellectuals, will still enjoy this show ,greatly in fact, But for someone who wishes to work in media with no distinct talent for it and have thusly spent my entire teenage years analyzing and spending hours reading reviews and debating about animation, sound ... design and writing. I cannot enjoy this show without at least a tad of guilt and sadness, Genuinely. So let's start with the story. Story-9 Now if you were to tell me the key plot points alone I would instantly be extremely engrossed, But only if you told me briefly, And I think that's what ""Story"" is, Art is execution. It doesn't feed you new information without explaining it at least somewhat with previous scenes and occurrences that we've distinctly seen, And so no plot points are forced. It has a bit of everything and always ramping up with feasible occurrences, And I can kind of believe the concept of ODM gear due to it honestly seems reasonable to try and figure a way to cut the nape accurately. And then training people in that, Though that's conceptual. It's actually handled like shit. Art-4 I really wanna give it lower, But the sakuga(Most polished pieces of animation) are breathtaking and the backgrounds that aren't CGI are some of my favorites ever, Even if it did get old using the same colors it still looks bearable. I had to scoff at 90% of last season anime for having unoriginal stock backgrounds. But what really matters is how they use animation in the minute to minute scenes. There's little to no story told in the animation, And what is, is poorly done horror is done with sweat drops and ""uh-oh"" faces when its not them being eaten, Bodies hardly move nearly as frantically as they should in horrifying situations. Bodies haven't looked gross or mortified to me once, I didn't see one interesting bit of someone being eaten, Not grinding of the teeth, Not intestine slurping, Nothing actually gross, Its only fake gore. [Redacted]'s body wasn't nearly as ""burnt"" as it should have been and was merely charcoal, It should've been popping and dripping with mixtures of melted skin and blood. THE COLOSSAL TITAN WAS CGI! their faces were zoomed in on and given shadows to show the majority of trauma, Anger, Anguish, etc. No actual genuine expressions ever since season 1(The best by far visually.) Now let me say something of a hot take, Art may mean visual but I also think it has to do with pacing, Storyboarding can be taken as either-or and is also what controls how the story gets from point a-b but also how its visuals are used. I would know, I've debated watching Shirobako. So why in the fuck did they think what should have been charred in and out the body and a person with a hole in his stomach would be fine to live a little bit longer with no one showing active concern for any time constraints? That is where I lost my investment, At least to the anime, My time is another story. Sound-3 Music in the op's and ed's dont count. They're always good-great on that spectrum. I can remember anything from the ost, Don't even know if there WAS music I was so detached in season 3pt 2 it was ridiculous. Hand tightening is the stock rubber sound, all explosions and damage sound the same with little difference between and overall un-impactful and made the massive flesh mechs sound minuscule when fighting, Granted the choreography and sakuga saved nearly every action scene from feeling dull.(Well done) Character-4 the initial hate was feasible thanks to season 1's take on it, And so were everyone else emotions. every character has some line of thinking visible in their actions and sometimes (though ugly and too obvious) facial expressions. At least to supporting cast. (Contradictory but what I mean is when they're supposed to express something so they show a little bit or way to much) but now everyone's drive is all mish-mashed and confused, People arent as degenerate as they should be, People's view of characters though supposed to be the honest interpretation of someone is inaccurate or way too irrational/bias without the character being distinctly written to be that way. [Redacted] was the best of them all 10/10 loved him to the end, Even if the end was a little anti-climatic and ruined his death for me. So I lied, didn't love him till the end, Fuck. Enjoyment-5 I liked it more then I should have, and will be, Like I said, Watching season 4, If only for the rumors of the massive amount of change in Erens character, Who despite the transitions being done poorly, The overall states of him are usually very entertaining. Overall/TL;dr-4 I can't give it lower than this(even if it's actual quality deserves it), It tried to be different and high quality but failed due to whatever, It was close, Real close. Some better quality control, more/better thought out world-building, time and maybe a few staff swaps and it could have been my favorite show ever, I'm a sucker for the concept honestly. Alas, It failed to deliver what feels like it was almost... The greatest anime ever created, Just like the reaction to season 1 told everyone. So. Fucking. Close. But no cigar.

This part of season 3 hands down had of the best anime fights to date and WIT Studios really put they foot into this season. Like that one Drake and Future song somebody needs to give WIT Studios a grammy or whatever the anime version ... of that would be. Of course this review is only for this season though.

AnimeBW,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*This is a joint review for both Part 1 and 2 of AOT Season 3.* In the close to two years since I’ve dove down the anime rabbit hole, I’ve experienced countless moments and sensations that have blown my mind and imprinted themselves on my appreciation of fiction for all time. I’ve been amazed by the stunning adventure storytelling of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood that has elevated it to my favorite fantasy narrative ever. I’ve fallen in love with Kyoto Animation’s storytelling thanks to Chuunibyou, and seen that love perfected with Hibike Euphonium. I’ve seen a reflection of my own reality in Kimi ni Todoke. I’ve been ... moved to tears by Clannad’s portrait of a life worth living. I’ve been stunned and surprised by the likes of Wolf’s Rain, Death Parade, K-On and Fate/Zero. I’ve lain my own psyche bare at the altar of Neon Genesis Evangelion and its movie finale upon countless re-watches. I’ve confirmed that the films of Studio Ghibli are exactly as legendary as everyone always says they are. I’ve had my entire perception of the power of fiction flipped on its head by Angel Beats. And I’ve experienced my single favorite piece of fiction of all time in the epic journey of Gintama. Anime has changed the way I look at stories, changed the things I value in stories, and given me so many invaluable memories along the way. And I know there will be ever more such experiences in the future that will deepen this appreciation even further. And yet, no matter how deep into this culture I get, no matter how my taste evolves, I always find myself coming back to the show that started it all. I always find myself coming back to a first episode, shown to me by a brother’s friend years before I would ever consider getting into anime as a whole, that entranced me with a world of possibility I could only begin to see the edges of. I always find myself coming back to the show I would later track down and watch and have my mind blown by, the show I continued when it finally picked back up and proved that my initial impression wasn’t mistaken at all. I always come back to that first taste of a universe that has come to define my fictional experience in the years since. I always come back to Attack on Titan. That’s always a statement that I feel I need to defend, because despite its titanic popularity, this franchise has been plagued with detractors and critics ever since it first grew into the breakout sensation that put the entire post-streaming era of anime onto the map almost single-handedly. You can’t go two steps into the anime fandom without finding someone’s opinion that the show is over-rated, overhyped, immature, badly plotted, dumb, never deserved its attention, you name it, someone’s said it. Perhaps that’s inevitable when you reach an audience as wide as this show has, but I’ve always been a little pained by some of the vitriol I’ve seen thrown its way. Because whatever its flaws might be, this story of humanity’s battle against a monstrous foe that forces them to live trapped like cattle behind walls has never ceased to sweep me away. I have constantly been left floored by its action scenes, carried out with riveting camerawork and consistently breathtaking choreography that makes you feel like you need a harness to avoid getting blown into the stratosphere. I have constantly been in awe of its ludicrous, twisting plot that throws a status-quo-reshaping reveal into the field like a molotov cocktail every few episodes. I have been constantly amazed at the dynamism of its presentation, elevating a dark, bloodsoaked narrative full of heavy political subtext and nihilistic undertones with a level of kinetic excitement that glues you to the back of your seat and makes your eyes threaten to pop out of your sockets. It is, without question, the single biggest adrenaline rush I have ever experienced in anime, possibly in fiction as a whole. To quote my MAL review of season 1, “Watching it is the equivalent of riding a massive roller coaster with fifteen loops, twenty corkscrews, and several abrupt stops and starts.” You can never rest let your guard down with this franchise, because it’s always got one more jaw-dropping swerve waiting right around the corner. And yet, as I’ve stuck with this franchise and kept thinking about it as I’ve delved deeper and deeper into anime as a whole, I’ve always been struck with an uncertain feeling that it wouldn’t last. There’s no way for a franchise to keep up a track record this crazy, this bombastic, this dangerous and hectic, without falling off the rails. How could a show running at such a breakneck pace have so much staying power? It was unsustainable. Somewhere along the line, something had to snap. The story would grow too extreme for its own good, the characters would get buried in the labyrinthine demands of the plot. the emotions would crumple beneath the weight of expectations, the charm would wear off and I would be forced to see this show for the empty shell it truly was. What if all the detractors were right? What if the rush of the action scenes was just a shallow smokescreen barely hiding the man behind the curtain, and all it would take was a single slip to bring the whole charade crashing down? What if there was nothing to Attack on Titan after all, and we had all just been suckered into an empty promise? Those were the thoughts swirling around my head as the third season approached, the first season I would be watching after officially beginning my love affair with the anime medium as a whole. Surely this would be the moment it broke, right? Surely now that I was more familiar with the medium and more confident in the kinds of things I look for in storytelling, the surface-level appeal of the show that got me into this mess in the first place would fade. Surely this would be the moment where I was finally forced to see Attack on Titan for the fraud it was, to acknowledge that the nostalgia of my early days was overwriting my impression of an utterly worthless show. Readers, I have never been more happy to be wrong in my entire life. My experience with Attack on Titan’s third season did not destroy my faith in it. Instead, it only proved to me that my faith was more justified than I ever gave myself credit for. Following the gobsmacking reveal of Eren’s powers at the end of Season 2, a story that has always been adept at subverting expectations to maximum effect jumps tracks and starts chugging off in a completely different direction than I think anyone could have predicted. Suddenly, the monstrous titans themselves are no longer the enemies we face; it’s humanity itself that stands in the way of the young Survey Corps cadets and their captains. Their continued campaign to break through the Titans and reclaim their lost land has brought them into conflict with the ugly, pulsating rot at the core of their society, the underlying corruption and decadence and pathetic weakness that’s always been in the background of the show. And as our heroes find themselves attack by foes old and new at every turn, they come face to face with an escalating series of mysteries tying the failures of the walled society to the unknown meaning behind the existence of the titans themselves. For the first time in Attack on Titan history, we are no longer stacking the deck up with more and more impossible questions; instead, it’s time to get some god damn answers. Secrets are revealed, lies are unraveled, truths are laid bare, long-standing questions are finally resolved, and at long last, our journey brings us back to the source of the show’s greatest, most enduring mystery: Eren’s basement, and the secrets his father kept locked within. And without spoiling anything, the ultimate reveal of what Grisha Yeager was hiding is so mind-boggling that it could use an entire essay breaking down the status-quo-obliterating importance of everything we learn there. I cannot stress enough what a monumental achievement the story pulled off here. This was the true make-or-break moment, the point where all the intrigue and excitement driving the plot would have to justify itself by proving that it was all building to something worth all the setup. And it didn’t just succeed, it soared like a goddamn phoenix, leaving any possible complain burning like ash in its wake. This entire season feels like a departure from everything that’s come before, refocusing the action down from the grand spectacle to the characters at its core, resulting in an increasingly aching, internally explosive story that defies everything you might imagine Attack on Titan to be capable of. The crazy kinetic spectacle is still here, but now instead of great armies charging across the field to face down hordes of slavering beasts, it’s a spectacle of claustrophobia and tension, of tight corners and sharp edges and a foundation that is flipped on its head not from above, but from below. The threat is more personally motivated than ever before, and a result, the stakes have never felt more cutting and desperate, more like every second these characters sweat and bleed is a victory earned through pain and sacrifice. It goes to darker places, plays on less comfortable emotions, seeking to undermine everything you too for granted about this story and the ways it’s supposed to play out. It flips the table on everything that Attack on Titan is capable of being, delivering an intense, hard-hitting emotional and political narrative that brings the show’s entire foundational logic crashing down one gobsmacking reveal at a time. And in the process it proves, once and for all, this this franchise has never been an empty shell. Because the reason the story works as well at it does- the reason all these reveals and upsets and reversals work as well as they do- is that the characters have all been build up well enough for them to be able to take charge now that the story truly demands the best of them. Over the course of the past two seasons, Attack on Titan has been establishing a truly remarkable cast of under-utilized players, people with rich internal lives and complex emotional journeys to go through, prepping them all like time bombs for the moment where it could finally detonate them as the tinder to burn its longest-standing walls to the ground. And watching them all rise to the occasion, taking the reins of the narrative and taking control of this increasingly hectic unraveling, struck chords in me that I never could’ve predicted. Eren’s growth and maturation casts his entire character into stark relief, proving there was always so much more to him than just the passionate roars of Yuki Kaji. Historia takes center stage and takes charge of resetting the domino pieces on a political situation spiraling way out of control, earning every ounce of faith Ymir placed in her last season. Armin gets a moment in the spotlight that finally tops his incredible display of courage back in season 1 and proves the worth of the journey he’s been on ten times over. Captain Levi and Commander Erwin find themselves facing the end of the line, forced to make hard choices and costly sacrifices that scar them in ways that will never heal. This season works because these characters work, because the journey they’ve been on has always been waiting for the right moment to truly make its presence known. And in doing so, it broke me in a million different ways and forced me to care for their struggles like never before. I’ve never cried for Attack on Titan before, as much as I’ve loved it, but this season shattered that paradigm too many times to count. It’s for all those reasons, now that I stand exhausted on the other side of the greatest reversal the show’s ever pulled, that I shudder to cast even a slightly accusatory glance back on the ride we’ve been on up until this point. Against the magnitude of everything this show’s achieved, what good could come from criticizing it now? And yet I must take that look back, because Attack on Titan did not pull this monumental feat off unscathed. By now, most of us have probably heard the horror stories of overwork at Studio Wit, how the team behind this staggering production was pushed to their breaking point time and time again, forced to struggle just to stay afloat and almost completely collapsing on more than one occasion. Even with the six-month gap between the seasons’ two cours, the strain on the production has never been more noticeable. The CG elements are more common and less well incorporated, standing out like garish, obvious shortcuts. A lot of time gets spent on still panning shots, and the pacing gets dragged down in the buildup to many of the most explosive encounters. You can feel the strain and sweat and tears behind every single frame of this season, how close the team came to total collapse time and time again, sometimes just barely cobbling together a worthwhile end result at the sound of the buzzer. The jaw-dropping action cuts and explosive direction are still there in spades, but the cracks in the foundation are plentiful and numerous. The whole show carries the kind of exhausted strain that makes it hard to even think about on occasion, a constant reminder of how much was unfairly sacrificed to keep this level of ridiculous quality up for months on end. I stand by my assertion that the story is better than ever, but the sacrifices it’s been built upon have never made it harder to love. And yet, against all odds, I still love Attack on Titan. I still love this breathless, off-the-wall, unendingly stunning adrenaline rush of a show that constantly keeps me coming back for more. And for all the pressure it’s stewing under, I have never had more faith in this story and everything it represents. So thank you, Studio Wit. Please take the longest break in the world to recover, you’ve earned the right to rest on your laurels a million times over. And in the meantime, Season 3 of Attack on Titan will stand as a monument to everything you’ve achieved over the past six years, a titanic story of epic proportions that has proven its worth beyond the point of debate. This show was the start of my anime journey, but no matter how deep into the wilderness I get, I will never cease to be amazed at how astoundingly well it keeps my pace. And for all those reasons and so many more, I will always love this incredible, remarkable show.",Season_3_Part_2

They were given an Anime with a shit story and tried to compensate with good animation and soundtrack.The soundtrack is genius btw. This is the season where all the ""bullshit"" started. I have read the manga and I tell you, its a lot of bullshit.... Read the manga for yourself to find out what I am talking about. But this is the season where Eren becomes the person we know in season 4. The only character I care about is Armin. And ... I felt sad when he was about to die. I can't wrap my head around how thicc Eren's plot armor is, you'll get what I am talking about when you read the manga. I wish everyone who hyped up this season a ""F*CK OFF"".

gingermemequeen,10,"Mar 23, 2020",0/0,"An absolute masterpiece. As a manga reader, I had been eagerly anticipating this arc, as it finally reveals nearly all there is to be told about the world of humans and titans. Everything seems to come  full circle in this arc as characters reunite, battles are fought, and a plethora of information is revealed. I unfortunately can't dig too deeply into this season without revealing a massive amount of spoilers, but what I can say is that while this season is only 10 episodes, it packs in an exciting, suspenseful plot, massive reveals, excellent fight animation (besides CGI Colossal Titan--though he is improved from Season ... 2), and a soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano to complement all the masterful storytelling being done in this season. This season of Attack on Titan rightly deserves one of the top spots on MAL, I believe, and if you've been following Attack on Titan thus far, you will be satisfied to have all your questions answered in this season. There is a lot to take in and a lot to appreciate from this season. It almost feels like a perfect ending, but as we know from the last episode of this season, there is still more to come, and I think the Return to Shiganshina arc does an excellent job bringing the series back full circle, ending the characters' innocence once and for all, and allowing a new era of Attack on Titan to shine through.",Season_3_Part_2
fgsdhsjsthsghh,10,"Jul 3, 2020",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the best anime that I have ever watched(as of 2020). It is one of the best animes out there. This anime has the one of the best characters,openings,music,story I have seen in an anime. - Fun Fact=It was one of the first animes that i watched! - This animes suprises you when you least expect it to(i don't think anyone guessed what was in eren's basement correctly). Each scene of this anime is well made and crafted. For example, let's take the kenny vs levi scene. Every shot of that scene is wallpaper material. of course, all scenes of the animes are not made with ... as much care as the kenny vs levi scene but the point STILL stands and the animation is just amazing with the dynamic camera angle of the maneuvering gear. The dynamic between characters of this show is also good. The music fits perfectly with the show even tho i was dissapointed in the 4th op but i am sure it has it's fans too. One strength of AOT is i think is that it will not progress like an traditional story would. Just when you think you have a grasp on how the situation of the story or how the story may turn out  bam it shoots a plot twist right at you. The fighting scene are also super good with one titan going against another target. The trill in those scenes are real!. The enjoyment i got from the series was 9.5/10(there were a few mistakes). If you are wandering wheather or not to jump in the series because there's a lot of catching up to do. Let me tell you it is well worth it. In conclusion, it's a pretty good show that has a potential to be the greatest anime franchise of the modern era. Heck it already is one of the greatest if you look at it objectively. - In this year of 2020 i am excited about a lot of upcoming animes and webtoons but AOT s4 is definetly at the top of my list. AOT has significantly improved from s1 to s2 and s2 to s3 and i just wish that it would improve in s4 too with the help of MAPPA (or just don't create the same thing that happened to OPM s2). Literally nobody wants aot to turn out like the same way OPM did but this time it seems more promishing. - -d35-",Season_3_Part_2

OsamaKIN-TMZ,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"My review only contains minor spoilers, but it's gonna take in account important subjects of this season's production, how it survived, and why it deserves a really high score, while giving it scores myself and summarizing some aspects of it, so enjoy, and hope you like the review and find it helpful to get you into the show. *WARNING_MINOR_MEMES.exe"" _LETS GET RIGHT INTO THE REVIEWWWWWW!!!!!!!!.... jk jk Anyway I will start with the first and second strongest subject for this season: >> Story >> 8/10 The story of this season follows after the little political clash in part 1 which was a great setup for the retaking of Shinganshina, that ... plays in an interesting and great pace, it feels like a chess game between Erwin and The Beast Titan, and I absolutely love it, but sadly that's not the reason I gave it a high score, the reason is the second half aka the flashbacks or in a better use of words, the memorization of Eren to Grisha's past and the truth of the basement as the bigger picture to something much bigger. Edians, Marley and Paradise Island, it all starts to mix up to give a taste of what's coming and fleshes out the story a little bit and gives it a deeper layered meaning, But I will let you adventure that on your own. The reason I really love the story of this season, in reality it is really nothing but a mere setup for the next season which really is gonna be something I'll tell ya that mate, but it's really well adapted by Wit Studio, what really shines a freaking campfire inside my heart is how my man Isayama (The Mankaga) made the story in a certain way and construction that it connects to past events, he even foreshadows some stuff really early on, and it makes for great re-watchability of the older seasons, and definitely helps to flesh out the story in a great manner... Now we're in my favorite subject as I am a damn Sakuga fanatic after all, but enter: >> Art/ Animation >> 8/10 This season was obviously mostly supervised by one of my favorites Arifumi Imai as usual, a young talented animator that joined Wit Studio first with Guilty Crown somewhat around 2012/2011, but he isn't an in-house animator, he is still a freelancer, but most of his work is in Wit Studio. Enough of Imai, lets talk about the problems we had this season, most of you will notice a big drop in polish and clean-up in the animation itself, it was because of extreme schedule problems as usual, but it wasn't as bad as Season 1, it was only a problem because of the focus on other projects. But we still got a fantastic act, which obviously was Episode 5, we got Imai greatness with the beast titan vs Levi cut, and the Eren behind Colossal titan cut, but we also got massive talents, like the Mikasa conclusion cut with lightning spear through Reiner's mouth by Mitsuaki Takabe and Teiichi Kato, and the Scouts against Reiner round 2 by the young freelancer Tingmu Yang, but there are a lot of cuts like Kai's Bertholdt transformation cut and others that would take too much time to mentions xD, BUT remember this could of been so much better with a decent schedule... But I allow Wit Studio as they do at least deliver story-boarding-wise mainly because of Araki, but still really good, and episodes like 6, 9 and 10 were polished even without actual out of the ordinary Sakuga, but AoT generally goes with polished art over exaggerated movement, anyway (I still hoped Ebara did a cut this season... Sadly he didn't, such an underrated animator). Wubba lubba dub dub! It has came to this xD, I am a little biased in this part, but it does deserve extreme praise and it's getting it dammit!: >> Sound/ Music >> 10/10 Now hear me out dude! I AM basing this rating on Sawano, BUT STILL, the in-house Wit Studio sound producers are professional, and you can hear it in set pieces by yourself, they are really good, and deserving of the praise. And the other aspect is obviously voice acting, and the talent behind the AoT voices, we got Kaji, Daisuke Ono, Kamiya, Inoue, Ishikawa, Koyasu and many more, they are all talented people known in the industry, I like the dub, but it doesn't even compare to the beauty that is the AoT VA staff. But of course, to anyone that remotely knows me, I LOVE Hiroyuki Sawano, so much that I own almost every damn album he ever produced... Yeah, I'm and extreme case... BUT ANYWAY, this soundtrack is beautiful and filled by many gems like Apple Seed, ətˈæk 0N tάɪtn, ShingekiNoKyojin, ThanksAT and other different rearrangements of other soundtracks... etc. The AoT soundtrack is definitely unique music-wise because of the talented Sawano, and we are definitely lucky by having him on this awesome anime. Long story short, IT'S AMAZING! and I refuse to rate it lower than 10, syck nibbbbbbbbbbba... sorry~ Here com th wey, the wey to tha queeeen and the characters so fill yyo eyes brodhars, cluck for tha queen *cluck* *cluck* *cluck* >> Characters >> 9/10 I loooooove, how Isayama gone and done it with his characters, every dialogue this season matters and holds and emotional meaning between the characters, so I recommend to always pay attention to them, and first and foremost have fun, for me little dialogue depth like that makes me chuckle like a school girl *he he*, but anyway, characters like Levi, Erwin and Armin have importance this season, and they are actually characters and not empty none filled hotpockets... (weird flex but ok me)... And there are a lot of characters that come and go this season, but they are done well enough that they don't feel forced or incomplete, we know enough about them that they feel important or at least relevant. But the thing that sold me on characters this season, is the growth that they gained (that's what she said), AND it well really affect their decisions on the future believe me (Eren will definitely get you by surprise next season lets just say that), but we've saw so much climactic and epic character moments for a big chunk of the characters this season that it really feels overwhelming in a good way, like the stuff with Armin, Erwin and Grisha were just *God damn delicious*, conclusion is, great character development done right can benefit the story by a landscape. Yeeet ma nibbbba, this show is a THOT and a good one, it's thicC with content and attractive with that general babe directing: >> Enjoyment >> 10/10 Do I really need to say anything out of the ordinary... WATCH THIS SHEEET BOY!, I ain't yo daddy, but I can tell ya that this shet is good and you'll at least enjoy it even if you are one of those ""Anime Elitists"".... Eh, well, ThAT's wHat I got To sAy Dawg!!. But honestly, I really enjoyed this until the end, hope you are the same, I only got annoyed about a few polish quality drops cause I'M A B*TCH!!! or a Sakuga-daddy-boomer-nibba... or something like that. 'Have fun' is my message... >> Overall >> 9/10 First of all I know this review is as trash as me, but at least I'm honest. don't pick on me dammit, I did my best, I ain't no reviewer, where I live in North Africa is hard to be an anime fan, so I just wanted to be myself for once and do a straight forward review of my enjoyment and love for AoT even if I'm pretty lazy sometimes, plus, I refuse to be a professional, what do you think I'm a Faaaaaa-gure----- I meant figure, don't kill me admins pls I'm not trolling. I hope you enjoyed the review, well at least 10% of it xD. Lets all be friends, no matter how life tries to split us, we are all brothers and sisters, and lets enjoy anime and have fun as we should be, cheers. >Sorry for any bad English+ I Hope the review wasn't too long+ I'm not trolling if it looks like it, I'm just being me (Even if nobody wants to see that xD). Hope you have a wonderful day/night odd person. ++And I got my favorite scene animated this season AND IT'SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS--- b*tch resting Levi expression at the beach, and long hair Eren... My life is almost complete... BUT WE STILL NEED SEASON 4!! WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EREN AND THE CREW!! FIND OUT ON THE NEXT SEASON OF SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Season_3_Part_2

This is truly a remarkable piece of art, visually and sonically. 10/10's across the board. A modern classic that will have people talking about it for decades to come. The story unravels in way that can only be described as ""genius"", not only does it answer long-standing questions, it produces more of them. It also incorporates a little real world history with some amazing foreshadowing. The Art can only be described as stunning, the transitions between art styles whether to represent more nostalgic moments or represent grim moments  was done ... well. The director brought the manga to life with the help of stunning symbolism and camera work. Absolutely genius. The Sound is in the exclusive club with Clannad as one the most emotion inducing sound tracks of all time. The end credits brought a tear to my eye.

Happiness, sadness, so many secrets to discover. This is our favorite anime series and we're glad, that we're watching it. The anime style is unique and very well made, you can see the mark of the mangaka on each character despite the fact that they are all very different.The soundtrack looks perfectly brings out the atmosphere of the story. Every scene has a song which fits perfectly. Each track is able to get us in the mood for the specific moment, being it ... sad, funny or exciting.

Kaizoku-Otaku,10,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"Contains spoilers from the third season but subtle as possible Every new season of Attack on Titan grows in many areas in an extraordinary way. The first one putting in more simplistic terms was simple and straightforward. Wall Maria was broken down by the Colossal titan, and the city swarmed by all kinds of weird and bizarre looking ones of his kind. Come to find out, the main character, Eren, had the power to turn into one of these horrifying looking monsters. Then from there on, it's easy to assume everything that could've transpired. Eventually followed by the season after when all these new elements started ... to pop out — for instance, learning about the titan's real identity that broke down the wall. Not to mention, all the signs at something bigger happenings in the shadow but still no good idea what it might be. This was also a time for characterization, as we see them more thoroughly developed and can now feel more tightly connected to them. Then you have the season 3 where Attack on Titan grows to a whole new height. You get to see deeper into the political aspect, and the titans are on the backburner for a while. We finally find out how they came to be, and the puzzle pieces are finally starting to fit in slowly. There was also light-world building to make sure the experience was even more fulfilling and satisfying. During the next part, the biggest questions of them all are finally answered. Titans history, among others, is revealed, and the mystery surrounding them. Although we still have quite a lot left to be exposed, so the theorists and predictions are therefore again running wild trying to crack the code and form a solution to what we still don't know at the moment. As always from the startup till now Wit Studio delivers yet again. It's clear by how much passion and love is put into every scene. When it's supposed to be invoking emotions if the situation is right, you can feel everything from sorrow, anger, excitement, confusion, and varieties others kind of feelings. Moreover, art is hugely detailed like you would expect from previous seasons, and it meshes well with the different moods and vibes of the current view or position. Animation too is insanely fluid and crisp, and there was not a single moment I taught it was feeling off. We had some small glimpses of not the best CGI, but it didn't make a dent in entertainment value and was quite easy to overlook. Being a manga reader myself, I can also safely assure you the ""pacing"" was impeccable, and barely anything or if at all was skipped. On the other, in comparison to the ""Uprising arc"" from part one of the season, which was condensed somewhat but if you were to ask me this was a really sound decision. It was profoundly political centered, and if it continued to be just that the audience, specifically a portion of the ""anime onlies"" or possibly even manga readers might've liked it less. Of course, thankfully, I was not one of them, and it was many that were able to appreciate it's grace too. Like any other seasons, we also had Hiroyuki Sawano delivers once again in the original soundtrack department with his undeniable impeccable and masterpiece of composition. The voice acting was simply outstanding too, and I find myself just like any other seasons, turning the volume full up during intense conversation packing lots of impacts to have an even more chilling and exciting experience which never has failed me. Attack on titan is no doubt something I would with confidence consider a ""perfect adaption"" up to this point, it's one of the best the anime industry has to offer, and anyone would have a hard time denying it as an actual fact. With the Final season thankfully set to be released during Fall 2020. The expectations are considerably high as you might've expected. If the studio or hopefully Wit continues to deliver justice as it has been during all these years. You can bet it will be another unforgettable mindblowing and thrilling experience. Suffice to say my anime of Spring season 2019 and possibly the entire year is already decided.",Season_3_Part_2
TheDarkEmperor,3,"Feb 1, 2021",0/0,"The following is posed to be a subjective constructive review of the 2nd Part of the 3rd Season of Attack on Titan. This review has been written around 2 weeks after finishing the 2nd part and thus will follow with vivid articulation of the premise and its categorisation. At the time of writing this review, it’s paramount to note that I watched the 1st season of Attack on Titan almost 7 years ago; therefore, I will avoid trying to make any grand connotation to the 1st season. Naturally, I might update this review should the consideration to re-watch Season 1 strikes me. Before you delve ... any further into this review, I must sign some precautionary advices for you readers:- -I will be discussing spoilers, so go back and complete Season 3 Part 2 if you haven’t yet. -This review is perceptually my own and shouldn’t necessarily convince or influence your point of view, if it does I’m in no way directly liable for it. -I won’t be summarising any part of the story, whatever events I bring up will be solely utilised for the sake of analyses or dissection. -This review is most likely going to be negative so beware of that before you read any further. If you’re a diehard SNK/AOT fan, this will very likely affect your amygdala and cause you to go into defensive mode. I will not be using any sort of profanity to drive my point but I’ll try my best to scrutinize as much as humanly possible. -I don’t think Hajime Isayama is a bad mangaka, he’s quite talented. I just happen to not be enthralled by his execution. For that matter, if I’m criticising the animation or sound, I’m not necessarily stating that the production team is necessarily uninspired but rather in a pull-push situation where they could have made better tweaks. -You’re free to respond to this or any of my reviews via this link. My only request for you would be to remain cordial. -If my review somehow matches with someone else’s, know that it’s just a coincidence and has nothing to do with me. They just happen to have a similar viewpoint, that’s all. With all those warnings put up, it’s time to delve into the review. Have fun and thank you for reading ! Introduction: Attack on Titan is a medium that comes from a genre which appeals to audiences that fall between adolescence and post-adolescence(Reddit is definitely not a valid source, neither is this survey but, it serves as a decent conjectural highlight - besides being 6 years old). Survival between humans and other species isn’t a setting that’s anything new in the field of entertainment but Attack on Titan does slightly innovate itself by invoking the ‘David vs Goliath’ trope. Similar to survival horror games, the premise of Attack on Titan follows a background of hoarding monsters that feed on the cast like there’s no tomorrow - at least that’s how one would explain it to someone who hasn’t watched the series. This is a fine way of explaining the background albeit a bit on the edgy and mainstream side. The other element that is rampantly present within the setting is its counter, which is of course the military. Keeping in mind that the military is often a toying part of every survival horror series, their fate here isn’t begged to be much different. In fact, it follows a lot of the same types of conclusions when taking a closer look. What makes Attack on Titan stand out is its political paradigm, which is often emphasized throughout the entire series. The influence of politics in Attack on Titan is very significant and the last 3 seasons ( rather 2 seasons and 1 part)  have done a lot to highlight that fact. But has this season lived up to that continuum ? Yes, it has and it continues to do so. It excels in presenting that element very well. If that were to be its only soft point, maybe this review would have been a lot more lenient but as seen, such isn’t the case. The centre of this part has been to reclaim the throne and glory - i.e. central point of story it left back in Season 1- I did say I wouldn’t touch upon Season 1; however, rest assured that this is the only time I’ll bring it up. Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2 establishes a progression in its plot with the intention of serving a better world-building storyline but assassinates a lot of its core dwelling tropes and elements with contrivances in order to make up for its plot convenient narrative; it tries real hard to create a tragedy out of its characters but at best, makes their presence superfluous or substitutes their shining armour for trying to set up a grander narrative. Plot: Storyline & Premise: The best way to possibly explain the trampoline that Attack on Titan is jumping on is by referring to the 20th century horror classic, Frankenstein, written by Mary Shelley. Without explaining the story much, I’ll dive right into my parallels with Attack on Titan. Frankenstein’s central theme, as argued by many academics, happens to be the ‘tabula rasa’, coined by Enlightenment English philosopher, John Locke. Tabula Rasa is the notion that a being’s mind isn’t preconceived or predetermined but rather starts off like a ‘clean slate’ as referred to by most philosophers before Locke came to coin the term. So you may be asking, how is this relevant to Attack on Titan ? Attack on Titan isn’t the only medium where such a theme is posited, it’s in fact a renown theme that you’ll find in lots of anime mediums as well. Attack on Titan strikes down on this theme pretty well by setting up its ‘grander narrative’ but when all’s said and done, Attack on Titan doesn’t handle it as well as one would expect it to. For that matter, Frankenstein doesn’t do the best job of handling it either but the parallel to be drawn from both are the prejudices that both the monster ‘Frankenstein’ and the ‘Titans/Eldians’ face in their respective stories. Are Titans really innately evil ? Are Berthold, Annie, Reiner, and Zeke’s motives justified ? This season answers all that in a nutshell by the very end. It can be conjecturally postulated that Attack on Titan doesn’t seem to agree with Locke’s theorisation as much as it should. No one should really be blamed for trying to write stories where anti-fatalism is a strong theme; in general, it’s hard to write stories without any form of deterministic offset. The very fact that a writer writes is enough evidence to suggest a deterministic outcome; however, a display of the theme is another topic and in this regard, Attack on Titan doesn’t hold a very consistent ground of the theme. The cellar/basement revelation holds itself as evident for it, given how strongly it encourages a storm back to its chosen land, will, and being. The ostracized past that Eldians went through won’t serve any medium-rare steak to them after all. Through characterisation, Isayama tries to evoke the question of the Titan’s innocence yet when the revelation plays out, the innocence seems irrelevant altogether. It’s simply ‘kill or be killed’. It leaves no room for the theme to expand any further other than perhaps trying to mingle it with the incumbent progress of the story - in which case, it’ll have to explain a lot of hurdles in order to make up for it, should it actually attempt to traverse that far. Ideally, it’s expected to but the way it’s going on now, it’ll definitely appear contrived. The initial setup of this season seems quite great from a bird’s eye point-of-view. You have pretty much what’s left of the highlighted cast going back to Shiganshina District. I will be honest in saying that I totally expected the story to roll this way and, I didn’t mind a single bit of that prediction. In essence, that would be the least of my worries. Given how this was an arc where we should have been handed some developments, huge portions of it remain amiss. It’s pretty much expected for military genre based series to have multiple and meaningless deaths here and there, Attack on Titan doesn’t do much different or does it ? That’s where the issue lies, it does which simulates a fortitude that isn’t developed enough to strike the plot progression. First off, sacrificing a good amount of the side characters for the motive or move of a main character doesn’t supply them with characterisation, it’s simply them shining in their essential breath. The character I’m speaking of is Erwin of course. While I liked how he sacrificed himself and his subordinates for the sake of the main cast, perhaps substituting his glory for another time would have been appropriate. I’m not by any means fangasming over him, I’m simply saying that wasting his death in this Season was uncalled for and solely a result of plot armour, nothing more. The contrast in this regard comes with the characterisation of Armin. The writing didn’t give Levi a well enough reason to not inject Erwin with the Titan fluid, it was simply an assumption Levi ran off of - even if Erwin refused it. Erwin’s refusal was definitely appropriate but Levi’s decision was still rash and illustrated poorly. The major issue of this part comes from how the fights carry out in Shiganshina District; don’t get me wrong when it comes to making antagonists overpowered. That is a fine and decent way to develop your protagonist and a good setup as well. That is a remark that can be attributed to any series really. While this part could have been a showstopper due to its setup for major fights, it neutralises the consequences of it poorly. Reiner’s initial defeat is quite warranted given how long Eren prepared himself for that battle. The inconceivable power of Beast Titan was overwhelming enough to facilitate the casualties but given how thick the Ackerman plot armour is, Isayama could have milked Levi further without the need for Erwin to intervene since Levi pretty much always gets a guaranteed win. Armin’s sacrifice was surely a peak point in the season and something everyone can appreciate from the series: in fact, the highlight of this part has been mainly Erwin and Armin. Erwin’s convictions painfully glamourized his death while Armin’s willingness to step away from his hesitation and taking command of the Survey Corps leads to a very decent progression of the military setting of the series. This is the kind of progression one loves to see from this series but sadly, it’s not enough to overpower the other flaws. As for Eren and Mikasa, there’s not much to highlight in the first part. While Eren gets his spotlight during the fight with Reiner and at the revelation, Mikasa has remained as bland as she has been for most of the series, it’s like she exists solely to babysit Eren whenever she gets the chance. While Berthold meets his lackluster unwarranted end at the hands of Armin, Zeke serves to live another day with Reiner. And it’s all thanks to……………………………….. Ah yes ! Mouthful Pinocchio with Invisible Armour Titan - Plot Armour of course. Cart Titan has to be one of the weakest plot devices I’ve ever witnessed. At first I thought Reiner’s consciousness transference plot device was bad enough but Cart Titan came to serve him another plot device. Reiner’s relevance slightly shines in later seasons but the fact that he was almost dead is excruciating to express even now.  On top of that, Zeke almost meets his end but gets hing fangled by the Cart Titan. Yes, some could say that this is a brilliant way to stretch the relevance of their characters but what's the point of setting them up in this season if all the storyline had to do was get the revelation from the basement ? Like seriously, Isayama could have avoided this arc altogether and the series would still have been able to progress on a linear note. The battle was simply meaningless for this part, all it did was simulate an excuse for fight scenes. The relevance of Part 2 is mostly contrived, very contrived.  I can’t even express how painstakingly forced this part was but to that extent, it at least tries to highlight some of its ‘submission’. Even then, it’s very delicate to ignore how this whole arc could have been much shorter and minimised. The worst part is what little intrigue they evoked simply vanishes the moment you learn the truth behind the Titans’ existence. I don’t have much of any complaints about the revelations apart from the fact that it’s simply another thematic mess and, if you haven’t read the 1st paragraph of this subsection then I urge you to go back and read that. That will convey my raw thoughts on the revelation. Despite Part 2’s short comings, I expect Season 4 to deliver what it has on its palette. There is still time for redemption and, I hope Isayama has used it to cover up for those illy executed plot devices. Characterisation: As discussed in the previous subsection, this part has been a grand highlight of primarily two characters: Armin & Erwin. While Eren’s characterisation has been set up in this season, it wasn’t executed so I can’t touch upon his characterisation as much as I would like to but, he probably needed some development for the event leading up to Levi’s Dilemma. On that note, Levi’s Dilemma perhaps highlights the Ackerman trait a bit, albeit it would be disregarded as simply a human dilemma. Throughout this arc, again and again Isayama illustrates how much of a zombie Levi is and leaves no room to iterate that resonance through its entirety. An e.g. would be when Levi asks Erwin to give up his dreams for the sake of the main cast. While some would say that this is a strong representation of the Ackerman clan, others might clay together the opinion that Levi is simply an archetypal representation of the Ruler. While Levi himself doesn’t appear suitable enough to be a ruler, he illustrates his conviction towards law & order time and time again. Armin’s characterisation is depicted largely through his command of the Survey Corps and his ability to strategize in the midst of battle; while at times hesitant, he is quick to come up with decisions that ultimately maximizes the danger to safety ratio for his squad’s scenarios or situations. The first highlight of his brilliance is displayed when he reveals Reiner’s location at the beginning of the fight: the art of deduction runs well in him and it can be argued that such is a setup for his future role as the commander. It’s easy to see why he gets contrasted with Erwin in this arc as his bravery at the very end to  Berthold triumphantly turns the battle around for the Survey Corps. This peak moment in the season is a display of what Isayama’s hand can do when he puts some mind to it. Erwin, the other of his brilliantly written characters comes to display but ends up in an unpleasant tragedy. Erwin perhaps takes the most devastating decision in this season overall. The border between his dreams and his liability as a commander to lead his squad into triumph truly illustrates the conduct his character is supposed to play. While leaving a good portion of the initiation to Armin, he still has to rush for a decision against the rest of the adversaries and when he does take the dire decision, his character stumbles yet knows what to overtake. Although Armin may have made the decision to solely sacrifice himself for a friend, Erwin’s utilitarian decision to decoy Zeke so that Levi can flank ultimately puts himself in a stable that is not worthy of anyone else’s taking. It’s a fair representation of how hard decisions are in a battlefield and Erwin warrants that extremely well. Eren’s characterisation rests and meanders solely in the revelation for now, it can’t be discussed as much here since it leads to spoilers for the following season. However, his place in this season as expected was relevant along with most of the cast but his character barely develops through the first half, the 2nd half gives way to his character to learn more about the history of the series. It’s through his characterisation that the audience learns much about the world outside. In that regard, his characterisation is decent. The only character I can’t say much about would be Mikasa since her role as iterated in the previous subsection, is solely to babysit Eren, that’s it. Her role isn’t prioritised in any other vein or form. She might as well be irrelevant other than that. The most stagnant characters however, were Jean, Connie, and Sasha. Their roles have been and always seems to be in the preservation of side characters and chess board pawns, they help out with the main cast’s plans and execute it, then viola, they’re done ! Hange, being a commander doesn’t need much highlighting since their characterisation is directly tied in with Armin’s & Erwin’s. Their character probably should have ended in this arc but like most things, it would have still been unjustified. For the cast of the antagonists, there isn’t much to say here other than how badly they were utilised. Yes, it’s true that Reiner as a character has some depth and so does Zeke but their place within the storyline isn’t as well executed, making them old rusted cookie cutters. As mentioned in my Plot subsection, their relevance in this season was quite unwarranted, it in fact didn’t have any place. But if I were to dedicate that line even now, it would be a bit contradictory considering that they did aid in giving those major characters a boost. Now, for some honourable mentions who won’t be discussed for obvious reasons: Cart Titan, Titan Injection, Reiner’s Consciousness Transfer, Zeke’s Hierarchy Of Survival Tips Animation: I’m not very good at judging animation or art style, so you’ll have to bear with me for this one and the next. It seems as if the quality of Attack on Titan’s animation gets worse each Season. Apart from the mention of the character stickers pasting on to the background, the showstopper has to be the C.G.I. Horses and Colossus Steak. My god, I laughed so hard when I equated Colossus Titan to a Steak, that must have been one of  my worst thought out jokes of this year so far. Given merit where it deserves, the art style is definitely decent and you won’t find me complaining too much about it. It’s not terrible but it’s not great either, that’s all that you’ll read from me in regards to its visuals. Sound: Again, I’m not a good judge of this either, I tend to leave this for last since it doesn’t pique my interest as much. OSTs are a bonus for any series, in my humble opinion. I typically don’t count them up against any anime. With that being said, the soundtrack of this season so far has been pretty repetitive and at times, tedious. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a huge fan of Sawano. I love everything he composes but come on, don’t recreate the same opening from the first season. That kind of says that Sawano doesn’t want us to experience his creation to its fullest extent, instead he teases us with some iterations. I don’t mind his stuff but this season’s OST hasn’t been much thrilling. Apart from that, I don’t have much to say in regards to the sound quality, it’s quite decent at the very least. Conclusion: To sum it all up, Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2 is a wasted effort on a storyline that could have been avoided for more innovative paths or takes. The resolution was met but the cost for it was abhorrent writing. While the arc itself is a poor one, some of the setups such as the revelation and Armin’s revival bear some fruit on what can be expected in the next season. This part undermines Attack on Titan and degrades it to perhaps its lowest point ever. Should such a progression path be taken again, it may as well put an end to the series’ list of potentials. In conclusion, this is the worst arc of the series.",Season_3_Part_2
LibertyPrime,10,"Aug 17, 2019",0/0,"I've been an anime fan for over a decade and when you've been around the block so many times it's easy to think that you've seen everything this medium has to offer. It's understandable given the fact that just like any other medium, anime tends to settle in it's own comfort zone, padding itself up with over used cliches or pandering to current trends. As it stands many shows out there don't push the medium forward as often as they should. Being as jaded as I am, I'd forgotten just how innovative anime/manga as a platform can be. It's a platform that can be used ... to tell stories which you really couldn't find anywhere else. I'm happy to say that Shingeki no Kyojin has reminded me just how versatile and ground breaking anime can really be. I remember still back in 2013 when the first season of Attack on Titan released. As usual I waited for the entire show to air before binge watching the entire thing. I finished it in two days which was a first for me. I had never really finished a 20+ episode show as quickly as I did with Attack on Titan but the show was like a drug which always found a way to hook you in and make you come back for more. Of course after it ended I yearned for more and as we all know the show went on a bit of a hiatus for several years, something which really hurt the show's momentum being as anime fans tend to have short term memories, as a result it's popularity waned. The show itself was something totally new for me, the premise was something I'm still not sure how the original author of the manga was able to come up with. To this day I wonder what line of thought lead him to his resulting creation. The premise of pitting an embattled enclave of humans against what were essentially man eating zombie giants highlighted the uniqueness of the show but furthermore it included cool steampunk technology which was the only means our heroes had to combat this nightmarish menace. Characters often died and the stakes were real. Alas, the novelty sort of wore off with subsequent seasons but I could still rely on Shingeki no Kyojin to supply me with consistent quality entertainment.  However, what the show was really doing was building up to this point. Focusing a little bit more into the genre itself one can easily deduce that Attack on Titan is a fantasy show. Being spoiled by the likes of Tolkien, Frank Herbert and Ed Greenwood I usually hold the fantasy titles anime produces in low regard due to one reason: The lack of a compelling detailed setting. If there's a reason why I love Middle-Earth so much, it's because such care and detail was put into the creation of the world. There's a general trend shared between the worlds of Middle-Earth, Forgotten Realms, Arrakis, and Westeros being that the settings are host to different peoples with a clear distinction in cultures and individual motivations. When such care is put into the setting it becomes easier to suspend your disbelief, this is something that I think the vast majority of animes (and JRPGs for that matter) usually struggle with whenever they delve into this genre. Attack on Titan does something that I've never really encountered before. Initially it offers a grounded believable setting. However immediately the viewer realizes is that the world outside the walls much like humanity's enemies is unknowable, a complete mystery. As such everything is engineered in a way that your view of the world is covered by what are essentially horse blinders and as the story progresses the world becomes just a tad clearer. What makes this more compelling is that fact the characters are essentially on the same boat as you. As a result the viewer is as invested in their journey to find the truth to this world as much as they are. It's absolutely brilliant. With that said, Season 3 part 2 was really is a turning point and general disturbance of the status quo for the show and if MAL charts are any indicator reminds us exactly why Attack on Titan has the stuff to become one of the great classics of our decade that will most certainly be revisited time and time again in the future. Without spoiling what happens during these 10 episodes we finally come to the realization of what exactly lies beyond the walls and the unique dynamics of the world. While the mystery is more or less resolved we're then hooked in by our anticipation of exactly how our heroes and the world inside the walls is going to deal with this new revelation, what actions will they take to ensure their survival? Funny thing how two episodes of this season are essentially exposition dumps but are done in such a way that doesn't feel ham-fisted or forced. Aside from the great story developments we get in this season we're also treated to a slew of awesome action packed sequences. The animation is more on point than it's ever been, the characters are as great as ever. One thing I also want to applaud is the mastery in how some scenes play out. Take for example when Eren and co are back in Shiganshina and walking towards the coveted basement. The build up to that scene was great, but the overall tone of that sequence was just superb. Everything from the music, art direction and even camera angles come together to craft one of the most uniquely compelling scenes I've seen in a long time in anime. In general this season is a solid 10 for me. It's reminded me exactly why I loved the medium in the first place. As such, Attack on Titan is a must see for any lover of anime and even fantasy in general.",Season_3_Part_2
Franktamas,7,"Aug 7, 2025",0/0,"The season has three arcs, each with vastly different levels of quality. The first arc is, honestly, quite good by the series' standards. It follows a plotline that, for once, develops more or less naturally on its own. Most characters behave logically based on what they know, and their actions show a basic level of human competence. It’s still fairly predictable, which cheapens the impact of character deaths—you can see them coming from a mile away. (As soon as a new character was introduced in Episode 1, I jokingly asked out loud, 'How are you going to die this episode?'—and sure enough, I got my answer ... by the end of that episode.) While there are some interactions driven by plot convenience, they don't pull the audience out of the experience. The main character remains a rare positive outlier in the series, seemingly immune to the writers' worst tendency to ruin characters in service of the plot. Then arc two happens, and every small flaw gets amplified, while the good elements are gradually abandoned. We fall back into the show's typical habit of forcing characters into imbecilic behavior to make the plot work. The writing clearly wants certain dramatic moments to land, but doesn't always earn them through natural progression. Once again, characters are violated to force the plot in a direction the writer clearly wanted, but couldn't achieve organically. Even previously well-established side characters are bent out of shape just to keep the plot moving. It becomes painfully predictable, frustrating, and, most of the time, just plain boring. The drawn elements looked good, but the generated ones looked terrible. Arc three is essentially a multi-episode exposition dump. To the show's credit, it does resolve a lot of worldbuilding questions that had been hanging over the series since the beginning. Overall, the first arc deserves genuine praise for its structure and character work, but the second arc drags the season down significantly. The final exposition arc is important, but nothing remarkable. 7.2/10",Season_3_Part_2
zztl9,10,"Mar 18, 2020",0/0,"Is it me or is our generation entirely fucked because of how often we are just absorbing more and more information and forgetting the ones we did before? But oh my fucking god, I love and hate this anime so god damn much lmao How did they even think of this plot to begin with? At the beginning, I assumed that they were stretching it out for some dank $$$, but now that I know all about it--or at least a good portion of what is going on with these titans, I can see why we have this many episodes. In the previous season (Shingeki no Kyojin Season ... 3), I thought it was really well done by those who are behind the anime, but this one just blew it out of the water, because we are FINALLY getting some character development in here with Eren. Everything that we assumed would happen with titans kind of happens and kind of doesn't at the same time--which is GOOD since we can't guess what's going to happen next, and that's what I look for the most in all these works, no matter whether they are anime, manga, films or just plain novels. Just the same as how Parasite won the Oscars for the best foreign film this year, because of how it did social commentary in an unexpected way. I can't wait to see what happens next. And hopefully, I will still remember that this was one of the few animes that got me so riled up by the time it's September, which is only 6 months from now--and that it doesn't get postponed by the coronavirus.",Season_3_Part_2
PyraXadon,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I want to start this off on a lighthearted tone by asking why they thought the most literal title was the best course of action for naming the season.  I mean it makes sense, sure.  But 'Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2' doesn't exactly roll off the tongue that well. Story: Picking off from the events of the first half, Season 3 Part 2 (which I'll just call Part 2 from now on) has us watch our protagonists of the Survey Corps years after the initial event of the series finally return home and find out what secrets lie in the basement of the Yeager family ... home. Action, suspense, tactics, and lots and lots of lore are what Part 2 is all about.  Harking back to the days of horror as the overwhelming pressure of these massive, naked beings takes hold, the two parts of Part 2 can be easily divided into the battle for the Shinganshina District and the truth of what lies in the basement, both of which acting as the series' earliest goals.  It's this clear, defined setup of dynamic and calculated action from two tactical fronts leading into the payoff of answers that has kept only the anime watchers in suspense for about six years that drives the show into this grand spectacle that culminates everything the series has shown us thus far. Personally, I think the Battle for Shinganshina is well worth the price of admission and is far better and exciting than what comes afterwards.  The battle on the wall is ultimately a battle of tactics and adaptation mixed with genuine fear and the dangers of war.  Here, everything from the voicework to the animation is top notch as two different fronts are being battled upon, accomplishing a multitude of goals which is made even better due to how often the Survey Corps is forced to adapt due to the changing tide of battle.  It's also the one part of the series thus far that really puts into perspective how this war has impacted humanity and just how many lives were lost.  The story told during this battle is so viscerally detailed that I find it difficult to look away at how much the stakes mean for the characters putting what little value their lives have on the line for the greater majority. In stark contrast, the payoff for such an amazing battle worms its way as the secret in the basement, which reveals itself to be a massive lore dump told through the perspective of Eren's dad.  Now I like lore; it expands the world and the world expansion done for AoT thus far has been pretty good all things considered.  However AoT has had a habit of making its lore EXTREMELY weighty. The world building this time only has about three to four episodes allotted to it, and is extremely dense in both its presentation and how it all ties into what we already now.  In essence, the world building reveals to us an entirely new section of the story that's only been hinted at before, an entire character backstory for Eren's dad, and more on the lore of the titans.  It's surprisingly well-paced for what it's telling, but it's a staggering amount of details to take in.  Part of me wishes there was a little more down time or just runtime in general to get everything in neatly, but I suppose the team was on a time crunch to get it out as it is in preparation for the finale. Overall though, I really do like what AoT has done for itself in this passing season.  Tactical and action packed battles mixed in with answered questions makes this a very, very satisfying season to watch for those who've caught up with the story thus far.  My only concern now is how the series is going to continue moving forward.  I fear large loredumps due to their natural tendency to lose the viewer's focus and sprout an entirely new setup that feels foreign to everything else before it.  With its incoming 'Final Season', a fear of mine now is that AoT is going to start muddying itself with its own story and collapse under the weight of its own world due to just how many facets of it now exist within its story, a likely result given how now the protagonists are turning towards their 'true' enemy after all of this.  And this is a threat that Eren and the others have never met before, and that's why I'm worried. Characters: Character's a bit of a hard subject in AoT now due to its vast amount of characters and increasing body count.  As far as arcs go, exploration goes towards Erwin during the Battle for Shinganshina and both the mysterious Beast Titan and Grisha Yeager during the reveal of the basement.  Most of the character time I feel is really only to fill in the blanks and help with developing the next part.  It's useful and at least for Erwin's part definitely helps to give weight to his character and the impact he's had over the course of the entire series.  However because the series has for the most part always been a story-based series, characters individually are given less of a limelight. This becomes a more abundant fact when Mikasa, Armin, and Eren serve roles that fit the current narrative rather than being the protagonists.  I've never been against these three not taking the mantel (far from it especially when Historia was concerned), but with regards to how the series has treated them these past couple seasons, I've honestly become a lot less invested in who they are beyond what they established at the beginning of the season at the idea of them finally 'Returning Home'. Aesthetics: Thank you Wit Studio for taking the time to really give it your all this season.  I was kinda upset when they announced that there was going to be a seasonal split into a 'Part 1' and 'Part 2' for Season 3, but seeing what they did, I'm actually really happy they decided to do it. Apart from the Colossal Titan's model and the horses at times, everything in this series is hand drawn to the style in such a way that I am basically climaxing at the sheer magnitude of quality.  If there was any other reason to say why the Shinganshina Battle is my favorite arc for this series, this would be it.  The constant closeups, the sheer terror on the characters' faces, lightning effects, dust clouds, shrapnel, massive property damage, slow down freeze frames of characters with ODM, Levi once again doing super extra and dramatic slicing shots, all happening during such a moment of pure do or die.  More so than anything, the art is just an outward, uncensored display of war.  You see the bloody carnage for what it is, and the haunting feeling of seeing it drawn in the anime is a feat that Wit needs to be commended for. And because it seems like we're just pulling all of the Season 1 cards today, ""Shoukei to Shikabane no Michi"", Linked Horizon's OP for this season of the show, feels like a massive throwback to the first OP as well as a multitude of different OPs and even a couple EDs that's been featured over the course of the series.  Personally I think it's a lot less coherent of a song than its predecessors due to its varying mix of styles and tones, but the mashup idea is pretty cool nonetheless. Cinema staff's ""Name of Love"" is very much the opposite as its more somber and appropriately 'homely' feel is a massive tone shift as it puts into perspective the hell the protagonists have seen the moment they joined the war against the titans.  I prefer the ED to its OP counterpart, especially since the ED treats us to even more Season 1 nostalgia with snapshots in reference to the days when they were in bootcamp just for that extra little kick in the nuts. Personal Enjoyment: I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a massive AoT fan.  Honestly, I thought the series was overhyped and borderline comical due to how many characters the show spit out only to be offed later on as mooks or sacrifices for the war.  It wasn't until now that the series outright tells the unnamed soldiers while they're backed to a corner, ""You're not returning home.  This will be your grave.  But don't die cowering in fear, die as a soldier fighting for humanity's freedom.""  And that's when my opinion of the series really changed. I used to really think that Historia's arc was the high point of the series, but boy was I fucking wrong.  The tone I think is really the series's main selling point.  It's typical 'facing adversity' that's standard fare for shonen series, but it's the presentation and vivid imagery of do or die that makes that message really stand out.  Not only that, but the Battle for Shinganshina is really THE culmination for the series's journey and it's this one arc that really sells me on this series as a whole because of how it stands as the climax for the heroes' journey through all of the shit happening in Wall Maria. I can't really recommend a 4th installation for a series that at this point is only for devoted fans, so I'll just say this as my closing statement: I hope this doesn't crash and burn.  You have built my expectations for this coming conflict to be so good, by god do not let your own now massive world building be the thing that bests you.",Season_3_Part_2
FarhanS7861,10,"Jul 13, 2019",0/0,"This was so great I had to leave my first review. I've been watching anime for a long time, and at first I truly thought Attack on Titan was sort of overrated, the story didn't seem too fleshed out.. I was wrong and I am sorry for those who have not watched this series after season 1. This season was truly a master piece, everything from the music, dialogue, voice acting, impeccable. This season/anime has to be one of the best of all time. I have watched roughly 100+ anime, and most of them tend to decline in quality as the seasons progress, but Attack ... on Titan has been topping it's previous season. To anyone questioning whether or not to watch this season, WATCH IT! There are so many high stake moments, and the delivery was on point. Definitely recommend anyone to watch this season/anime, I had surpassed all expectations from the manga. Looking forward to the final season next year.",Season_3_Part_2
ShadyLampShade,10,"Jul 28, 2019",0/0,"Wow. What a mind blowing season. The wait for it was certainly worth it. If you were disappointed that S3P1 didn't have much of the action that you imagined, don't worry because this was an explosive series. Story is one of the best aspects of Attack on Titan because everything just makes sense. The characters are smart, not stupidly entering a battle without forethought. Hajime Isayama has crafted an incredible story that leaves you wanting more. You never want the episode you are watching to end. Season 3 Part 2 contains some of the most crucial stages in the anime's story. Animation is amazing, fight scenes ... and epic moments are nothing to scoff at. Quite literally eye-gasmic material. The setting is also very beautifully laid out, much of what you are familiar with. Hiroyuki Sawano once again deserves praise for his marvelous soundtrack. Crazy moments are elevated by the music and calm moments are diluted. Seriously, you're gonna wanna check out the soundtrack after watching this season. Character's are tested. Many are broken. It's been years being a part of these characters lives. You've followed them through their journey and endeavors across Wall Maria. This season contains an insane amount of pivotal character moments. So be ready, because I wasn't. ;_; Overall, this season was a masterpiece if you've been following the series since the beginning. The only downside to watching it now is having to wait years for the last season.",Season_3_Part_2
seulkennerz,10,"Jun 18, 2020",0/0,"Bear in mind this is my very first review. First off, all the plot building and character development truly paid off. In my honest opinion, this is the best season of attack on titan created thus far. Story: The story in itself had many twists and turns and many pay offs that did the anime justice. I can’t say much about the story without spoiling, but it kept me on my toes while I watched it. I’ve always been fascinated with how captivating and intriguing the story of attack on titan is, especially with all the flashbacks and memories that truly connect me with the characters. ... I feel like I know the characters better or I’m able to understand them much better after the fact that I was able to see from a different point of view. Art: The art style has always been one of my favorites, there are times when the colossal titan looks funny in respect to people on the ground, but the art style nonetheless is one of my favorites. The art style of attack on titan has evolved after each season, only getting better and better with the animation of battles. Especially seeing Levi shoot across the sky fighting titans, which will always be one of my favorite scenes. Sound: The opening song isn’t as spectacular as first season’s but the sound quality and voice actors is truly splendid. I also feel that as attack on titan has progressed the sound quality has gotten better. I don’t have much expertise in the sound department, however, I have absolutely no complaints with the sound presented in attack on titan. Character: The characters in attack on titan are truly the best characters I have seen, especially after watching Grisha’s life and what he had gone through. It makes me appreciate and relate more to the characters, which is what characters should do. I wasn’t a big fan of Grisha, but after watching his backstory, I was able to better understand why he thought a certain way and I became much more interested in Grisha because of it. I feel the best character represented in this season would be Levi, with all his fight scenes and honestly, his wonderful personality, he truly deserved all the screen time. As I was watching this season, I noticed how not only were characters given backstory/memories but already existing and well-built characters were given even more rich and amazing development. Yes, I’ve read the manga and yes, I absolutely love how attack on titan is one of those shows that doesn’t stray from the manga whatsoever. Enjoyment: I absolutely freaking loved this season! I won’t lie and say that most of my enjoyment wasn’t from seeing much more screen time from Levi. The first season of attack on titan is what grabbed my attention in the first place, but this season it truly heated up my excitement for what’s to come. If you love fight scenes, beautiful character development and wonderfully executed world building then this season is a must watch. Overall: 10/10 favorite season of all time Thanks for reading my review, I hope it wasn’t too bad~",Season_3_Part_2
DrSkive,10,"Dec 4, 2020",0/0,"Amazing, absolutely amazing. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2, is amazing. After the, needless to say, a bit of an underwhelming season 3 part 1 of attack on titan, season 3 part 2 makes up for everything. It starts of with a slow, calm pace, with the scouts searching for the traitors among then, in the walled off district in Shiganshina. After many failed attempts and Eren plugging up the walls holes, Armin BigBrain finds out that they have walked into the enemies hands, and that they were hiding inside the walls, So, after the overly dramatic and hype reveal, they start to fight. Reiner ... vs Eren and the scouts, and Zeke vs levi and erwin and.....the side characters. So they end up divising a pla- oh wait bertholds here. So berthold fucking nukes the place and kills everyone around him other than the main characters because....duh. So things are looking bad. Reiners nearly dead and Berthold is humungous. Whats the plan? Armin comes up with a plan so he and eren can kill berthold with them both seeing the sea. On the other side of the wall, Erwin Baddas leads the troops on a suicide march to kill the monkey and they all die, except from levi, who kills the beast titan and the person inside. Or not. The beast titan user gets taken away by the cart titan :0 and levi is the only one alive on the other side of the wall.....or is he. Yeah so armins dead, forgot to mention that he died while helping eren kill berthold. And then comes the best episode of Ainme, in my personal opinion. Attack on Titan, season 3 episode 18. The most heartbraking episode. It starts of, with eren, looking down at armin, his body burnt to a crispy. He hears Zeke approaching him, and threatens to kill berthold if he tries anything. Zeke replies ''You look nothing like your father.'' Before we can know what he's talking about, levi, with an evil look on his face, slides down the wall, onto the rooftops and chases after zeke. After levi makes it to eren, he asks for his fuel tanks, but before eren can give it to him, Armin is revealed to be alive. A few houses away, jean connie hange and mikasa are planning to kill Reiner, but unsuprisingly, Zeke comes riding in on the titan and takes reiner back, leaving armin to be the one to inherit the collosus titan. That is, until The last remaining survivor brings back a wounded erwin. They have to decide who to bring back. Erwin, or Armin. This episode is heartbraking. This was achieved by the environment.

Constant changes in balance, hard decisions, sacrifices, grueling tensions, and mysteries uncovered makes this a fitting end to many of the goals set in the beginning of the series.

Eleiryn,10,"Aug 8, 2019",0/0,"It's an odd thing to review a show that relies so heavily on twists and reveals - it's hard to give examples of good or bad writing, hell, it can ruin major events to even namedrop some characters interacting with each other. So I won't cover any events, just themes. If season 1 was action and season 2 was character development and plot, 3 is all of them at once with an additional focus on world building; countless plot threads from 1 and 2 FINALLY make sense, defeats and events of the past resound in the present as characters learn from their mistakes, and seemingly meaningless ... events and scenes suddenly gain grave bearing with new information. There are plenty of bombastic fight scenes and lots of very calculated combat to boot - VERY high stakes in many regards. As always, you can never trust plot armor; anyone can die, and that adds a real sense of tension to fights, especially when things get desperate - and they do. The soundtrack, visuals, and scenes all combine to play with the viewer's emotions quite impressively; there's little meaningless melodrama or crocodile tears to be found here, anguish and joy alike are EARNED through blood and... honestly mostly just blood, holy crap, there is a LOT of violence. Honestly though, if you're up to S3P2, you've watched the rest of AoT and know what the series is about. Did you like the previous stuff? Congrats, this is that, but WAY better; not just a trite continuation but an evolution of the formula that brings the show to entirely new heights. If you hated it... well, it's ok, I bounced off season 1 as well, but this one is totally worth it. I don't give 10s easily, but I can't in good faith NOT offer them when deserved, and this anime is easily one of the best ever made.",Season_3_Part_2

Make sure to watch previous seasons of Attack on titan to understand the complete story because this part summarizes all what's and why's. Levi, Mikasa, Eren, Armin and rest characters were simply amazing. Levi won the show, he was unstoppable, his skills without any superpowers just surpassed people like Eren who is having titan power.

Nevertheless, after watching this season, i guess most of them have changed their opinion. Having watched several animes, from my point of view not all of them are capable of create such an amazing story. ... Everything fitted perfectly in this season, from the beginning of the story (season 1) up to the last episode. -Art: 9/10 Despite having a fantastic animation, i cannot give a 10. 3D colossal titan was poorly animated, its movements were not realistic and the contrast between 2D and 3D did not fit well. Addiotionaly, in my opinion animation got a little worse in comparison with previous season. -Sound: 10/10 Shingeki no Kyojin has the most epic anime OST by far. Nothing more to add here, simply remarkable. -Character: 9/10 On one hand, characters such as Erwin, Levi or Reiner represent perfectly how an anime character must be constructed and developed. Berthlot and Zeke have also had a great importance in the season. Secondary characters played their role well, but i expect a bit more of the main character. -Enjoyment: 10/10 I totally enjoyed every single episode of the season. The time passed so quickly watching it. SnK is considered to be an anime that almost everybody likes, and this season is not an exception. Moreover, if you are a huge fan of the previous season, this one will make you enjoy even more. -Overall: 10/10 To be honest, this season became SnK my favourite anime.

darthgera,10,"Aug 29, 2019",0/0,"When i first watched Attack on Titan, i was coming of the back of Tokyo Ghoul and i wasnt really impressed by the constant twists and turns. That said, it was enough to get me hooked and I kept getting more and more invested. Fortunately, season 2 aired that time and boy that was the moment when I was sure that this was not your usual anime. The change of pace and genre caught me off guard. No stupid clothes changing scene, no more pointless shouting, this anime meant business and boy the forwardness and maturity displayed in handling lgbt scenes was simply brilliant. There was ... no over the top melodrama and Erwin continued to inspire. I kept falling more in love with Attack on Titan when season 3 aired and the change of villain, as well as genre, again was brilliant. That said my only complaint was from the previous season was the runtime of Levi and oh boy they more than made up for it in the second episode only. The pacing was slow,, but the overall season was enjoyable. When they delayed the part 2, I was pretty pissed, but after watching it, it was totally worth it. I cannot get bored of watching Levi destroy Zeke and Eren taking the piss on Berthold. The reveal of the basement was worth the wait and hype and got me so excited that I read the manga up ahead. I finally understand what you cant handle the truth meant as it completely changed the show for better and Eren to the point that he wont never shout again. So as someone said we are in the endgame now, the culmination of all what was good in AoT, cranked up to max. The season wasnt rushed, slowed when necessary and cranked up when needed. This art as fantastic as always and so much so that right now I would rate it as high as Full Metal Alchemist  Brotherhood. The payoff as good as Breaking Bad. Probably the only show whose anime is better than manga because nothing beats ""Rage my soldier, Scream my soldiers, Fight my soldiers"".",Season_3_Part_2

The story is one of the best plots to grace any medium in the last decade, the animation is beautiful and on-point (episode 54 was a masterpiece, animation-wise), the sound design and composition is perfect (guaranteed goosebumps), and the character development and their struggles are believable and resonate deeply with the audience. No other anime, tv show or movie has made me feel so invested in a storyline. The other seasons had some minor issues (pacing being the biggest issue) but WIT seemed to have fixed all ... the problems from previous seasons and that has culminated in some of the best and visually appealing stories we've ever seen. Overall 10/10 masterpiece",Season_3_Part_2
chrisbk8,10,"Nov 23, 2020",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the most influecial anime of the last decade! First, let me preface this review with I'm an absolute AOT fanboy. It's my second favourite anime of all time; My favourite is FMA B. However I think the best method of pushing Attack on Titan to new heights is too hopefully be very critical. Animation: This is definitely the most polarising part of this season (Colossal titan). But I wanna start with the positive parts first. The ODM gear animation is some of my favourite animation period. It really allows the animators to create something dynamic and thrilling, because of it's 3D style. In my ... opinion, it really helps to add scale to not just the surrounding, but the Titans as well. Lets not even get into the dopamine rush I get when Levi ""swings by"". As far as this animation goes this season, I'd say it's very much on the level of part 1 (incredible). Even tho there hasn't been as much on display. So next to the Titan side of the animation. First, Reiner and Eren's Titans both of which are better or at least on par with previous seasons. So essentially very good at minimum. As far as their fight goes I'd say it was better than any previous season Titan vs Titan fight. I think the only thing that held it back was just the pacing of it, at times movement was slowed to create a ""dramatic effect"". I would have been fine with this if it was only done once. That's the only criticism I have for that fight, so I excluding that I thought the fight was stunning. Now on to the ""colossal fuck up"". Haha, see what I did there. This CGI isn't good. Anyone that defends this Roblox's titan, just know that you're not pushing AOT up. Your anchoring it down. While it isn't as bad some people make it out to be (me). Considering AOT is by far the most substantial anime of the last decade. It should be held up to a higher standard of animation. To conclude I think the animation so far is a strong 8/10. Plot / Charaters: So far we haven't exactly had many touching moments with any charters, but that's for the most part, is because of the hyped nature of this arc. The most substantial character moment so far wasn't massive for me as it is featured in an ova. But with that being said the plot is nothing less than exhilarating. They really did decide to jump in head first. My eyes are literally glued to the screen, I can't take my eyes off. Personally, I love shows that build a great foundation in earlier seasons and then pick up the pace later on. Which is exactly what they've done so far. Another thing I love about this arc is the emphasis that is put on the tactical aspect. Erwin and Armin are by far the tacticians of the year. I must admit though it is nice to see Armin get that screen time. We are defiantly moving towards a big reveal. I can't wait to find out what's in that basement God dayum. To conclude so far this is one of my favorite arcs of the entire show. 9.9/10 Intro: Two words: Absolute Tune. 10/10 To conclude these last 4 episodes are some of the greatest anime I've ever seen. This show has already carved itself into history. So let's just hope they fixed the CGI in the upcoming episodes. If that is done, this could become one of the best seasons of anime ever to hit the screen. Overall Rating 9.5/10 TOTEMO TSUKI",Season_3_Part_2

In this way, many old characters die, and more and more new characters will come. Well suited for the change of the last season. But actually I'm still confused why the wound on Mikasa's cheek hasn't disappeared either, maybe there is a certain purpose. What's more, the animation that is getting better makes it more interesting to watch, but sometimes I feel disgusted by seeing something so real like a burnt corpse. But that's AOT, I can't complain because the story is like that. What's more, ... that's what makes the whole story even more great. It's really different from one piece where the character should be dead but not made to die, the feel is very different. And it is true that the more complicated the story is, the more interesting it is to find the answer. And for this season thanks we can see Levi in ​​more action. There are also more jokes in this season, hopefully the next season can be even better.",Season_3_Part_2

Few pieces of entertainment can successfully mesh brilliant storytelling with breathtaking action on a regular basis, just these two facets of AoT are enough to put at the pinnacle of modern entertainment. AoT has been brilliant since the first episode, and Season 3 Part 2 has reached heights that no one thought possible. Every moment of this season draws you in, from its impeccable action to its exceptional character building there is no area in which this season fails in my opinion. The music is awe-inspiring, seriously I watched the season twice just so ... I could hear the music accompany the anime. These show has been getting better and better as the seasons have been released, and from what I hear from manga readers, it only gets better, so if you're a new fan of the show or someone who lost interest in the wait period in between season 1 and season 2, I hope that you'll give the show another go, I promise you won't regret it.",Season_3_Part_2

kairyu_gen1,6,"May 4, 2020",0/0,"Everything to make a great anime is here. It’s got the simple but deep plot, the tear-jerking character moments, the superb visuals, it’s got it all, but it just doesn’t come together in a satisfying way. Do you remember Season 1? Of course you do, everyone and their mother saw the first season of Attack on Titan. For all the criticism it got, it knew how to do one thing: it knew how to make something feel like a big deal. The specific example I want to bring up is retaking Trost, between the dialog by the characters, the music, everything, we knew it was a ... big deal. It was the first real victory humanity had ever had against the Titans, the first glimmer of hope, hundreds of people died for that tiny victory, and it felt like it was worth those deaths. If I told you right after that retaking the wall and winning the entire war with the Titans would be treated as a footnote, how would you have felt? You’d probably laugh me off, but that’s exactly what happens here. The series is so preoccupied setting up what’s next, that paying off all the hours and emotions that have been invested up to this point gets...forgotten. Let’s take a look at what’s changed since Season 1: the main characters are still surrounded by an overwhelmingly powerful adversary, Eren is still completely defined by his obsession to defeat his enemy and has little character beyond that, and...wait, is that basically the whole show? Okay, fine, there was a lot of side content like the political fights, but let’s be real, those weren’t the appeal of the show. The appeal of the show was Titans, how overwhelming they were, how mysterious they were, how they affected the characters, and now that they’re gone we’re stuck with...Nazis? I might be overblowing the racist internment camp parallel, but the new antagonists just don’t have the instant impact Titans had at all. Then there’s the characters. The only character that had any significant growth this season is Armin, he gets a little bit of the spotlight and actually thrives in it. Eren is baffling to me, he started the series strong, showing real human emotions like anxiety for about 5 minutes before he puts his angry face on again. So much happens to him this season and he just doesn’t react. He retook his home town, does he react? Nah. He finds out his dad wasn’t a murderer, and actually loved him, does he react? Nah. He finds out his enemy is his brother, does he react? Nah. He’s been basically reset back to his Season 1 self, except instead of shouting about killing Titans, he just internally broods about the new bad guys with nothing to his character besides that. Erwin though is the big complaint I have as far as characters go, because he has easily the best moment in the season if you look at it in isolation. When he leads the scouts in the suicide charge, preaching about laying down your life, trusting your successors to make your sacrifice worth it, it’s incredible...until you remember he already had this moment in Season 2 when he lost his arm. That moment in Season 2 was great, it was high action, and it spoke volumes of Erwin’s character as he prioritized Eren, mankind’s only chance at survival, over his own life, making him a selfless, dedicated, and pragmatic leader. Then they retconned that in Season 3 by making him a selfish gambler who only goes down because he gets backed into a corner and his best friend thinks he’s better off dead. What? No seriously, what? Great moment sure, but Erwin’s whole character is just a mess at this point, one good moment doesn’t salvage him. This season left me unsatisfied. We've invested a lot of time and emotion to get to this point, and to see all of that ignored just to set up a dramatically less compelling next arc is so disappointing.",Season_3_Part_2
Injenss,10,"Jul 5, 2019",0/0,"RAGE MY SOLDIERS!!!! Seasons like this are so rare.  They are so very, very rare.  Even among the golden age of anime of the 90's and early 2000's, experiencing an anime of this kind of legendary quality was a rare treat.  And make no mistake, this anime, just off of this season alone, will take its rightful place along side the Cowboy Bebops, Code Geass' and Death Notes, as an all time great anime that people will never forget. This anime just DELIVERS.  It delivered on every possible front.  The gigantic battle sequence that runs the entire front ... half of the season delivered.  It was easily the most amazing fight of the entire franchise.  ""Perfect Game"", in particular was just astonishing to watch.  AoT has always been good at displaying the emotional depths of despair that the Scouts face when battling the titans.  But, this was a masterclass in showing bravery in the face of despair.  And I must heap special praise on the animators who perfectly drew the look of pure dread mixed with courage in the faces of the scouts who rode in ""Perfect Game"".  Especially the person at the front of the charge, who I won't say as not to spoil it. ""Midnight Sun"", however, that is the episode for which I believe, this anime enshrined itself as an all time great.  That presented the most incredible moral quandary I've ever seen in an anime.  This episode is where the flash-forward in Pt. 1 of season 3 takes place with Levi striking Eren and Mikasa attempting to kill him.  If you thought that preview truly encapsulated the gravity of that moment, you have NO IDEA until you see what is actually happening.  It turned out to be way more intense and shocking than I ever expected it to be. But, to follow up ""Midnight Sun"", ""Perfect Game"" and ""Hero"" with ""That Day"" and ""Attack Titan"", it was almost too much goodness.  ""That Day"" and ""Attack Titan"" finally explains, in full, the history of how this world came into being.  To be honest, after season 3 pt. 1, I was expecting a pretty crappy and mundane reveal for what the Titans were.  I was totally wrong.  I won't say anything as to spoil it, but the full reveal turns the entire world on its head, and actually changed the way I perceived all of the wall dwellers and the Titans.  The back story was about as great, well fit and emotional as you could get. This season represents a dramatic increase in quality of a show that was already stellar to begin with.  I was concerned that things were going to start going downhill at the end of Part 1 of this season, but instead, this season took this anime to truly legendary heights.  My favorite anime of all time is Hunter X Hunter 2011.  One of the reasons for that, is the dramatic shift in quality that occurred out of nowhere when the Phantom Troupe arc began.  Attack on Titan Season 3 pt. 2 has done the same thing.  These are the kinds of seasons that puts an anime into the ""definitive anime of a generation"" territory.  It is really THAT good. Watch this. Watch it.  WATCH THE SHOW.",Season_3_Part_2
rathum2323,1,"Mar 30, 2021",0/0,"Shingeki no Kyojin, or Attack on Titan (which is a mistranslation, it's actually The Attack Titan) Final Season is an absolute trainwreck but it has been the case since Season 1 ended. The story is dreadful, completely morphed from Season 1 which was the entire appeal of the show. It is full of plot holes and plot conveniences. Use of amnesia plot device to explain everything away is lazy writing, and nothing makes any logical sense. I'm certain the story is written to be woke and designed to ride on the blind following of liberals. Adds several liberal ideologies that have no place in the show ... and have zero relevance to the plot. Devolves to absolute stupidity like time travel, amnesia, magic, sorcery. The plot twists are silly and not entertaining for an intellectual audience. Regarding the Art, and this is a problem with the source material itself, too many of the characters have the same 'thousand yard stare' dead eyes, it's like the eyes are copy pasted on to all those characters. Their eye expressions never change, and that is just excruciating to watch. Can't complain much about the Sound, it was ok. Characters are dumb, poorly written, and I didn't even care if they lived or died. Ton of new characters introduced also dumb and poorly written that I just can't care about. Too much focus on bad characters. Almost none of the characters endear themselves, they aren't interesting and can't carry the story. None of the characters are realistic and relatable, many are just one-dimensional. The more detail that is shown about certain characters, the more unlike-able they become. Enjoyment, I can't rate it any lesser than 1 or I would have given a zero. Who likes to see characters they don't care about stand around and talk for lengths just infodumping things you don't care about to make an already convoluted and illogical plot even more so. The titans fighting can be cool at times but who really wants to sit through all the garbage to see a few seconds of Titan fights. Overall it's a 1/10 for me. AoT should have never come back after Season 1 because now we all we have is a titanic piece of turd that people keep polishing and presenting to you as gold.",Season_3_Part_2
Volvagia,7,"Oct 10, 2019",0/0,"To say I am disappointed in the anime community for its reception of Attack on Titan (AOT), Season 3, part 2(S3P2), would be an understatement. Don't get me wrong; I do not think this season was terrible. I thought it was good, but I certainly don't believe it to be God's gift to anime. I certainly don't feel that this season deserves the honor of being in the prestigious 9's club (i.e., 9 on MAL's 10 point scale). The 9 rating is something that is supposed to be a hard task with only nine shows/movies accomplishing and holding onto before this season. With my bellyaching ... out of the way, S3P2 of AOT is still very good, with me waffling back and forth on whether I would award it an 8. The story for S3P2 revolves around the scouts battle to retake and repair the wall from enemy titans ( the sentient ones not the dumb ones). With the direction of the final season being revealed in the famous basement, which is something, the show has been hyping up since the first season.  Once that was revealed, it didn't strike me as bad in the first place, but once I thought on it completely changed the nature of the show and not in a good way. Especially since the AOT series now reminds me of a particular Hollywood movie that was bad. By a director known for his ""twists,"" and I feel like that is saying too much. There were also after battle decisions I disagreed with, but I could overlook those, unlike the basement. The whole battle was pretty cool, and that what salvages S3P2 for me. Animation wise still above industry standard, and the soundtrack is still pretty good. I enjoyed AOT S3P2, and I do recommend continuing to watch it, but temper your expectations as the hype around it, I believe, is misleading.",Season_3_Part_2
RyanSpring,8,"Sep 30, 2020",0/0,"Part 2 of season three is very good, but it's overrated because part one really is that bad, which makes it seem a lot better than it is by comparison. Yes, the battle that we get is pretty epic, including multiple major character deaths, but when you have your audience foaming at the mouth for any action whatsoever, since there's very little of it in the slow and boring first half of this season, imperfect becomes a lot more acceptable. And, indeed, imperfect this is. I strongly dislike the decision to implement the Colossal Titan with CGI when it had been traditionally animated in both seasons ... prior to this. Also, puzzlingly, in SOME shots the Colossal Titan is full on CGI but in other shots it's traditionally animated. It sticks out like a sore thumb and not in a good way. Also in the epic battle there are many missed opportunities to land the killing blow because the characters would rather talk instead. Many anime do this. It's certainly not an Attack on Titan exclusive problem. But, nevertheless, it's something that always bothers me and breaks immersion. Throughout the entirety of the season, not just part two, I felt like the English language voice actors/writers went too far in trying to ""Americanize"" or ""localize"" the dialog, often throwing in random phrases like ""big-ass titan"" that felt really forced in and out of place. I'm a native English speaker and largely favor dubs over subs, but Attack on Titan is one of those anime where, without much argument, the original Japanese audio and writing are simply superior. This is a problem that has persisted throughout the entire series. Season two had English lines like ""what's the end game here"" that just don't fit. It's a clear attempt to appeal to a target audience- teenage males. Also, while the epic battle is the clear highlight of this season, once it's over we're back to exactly what plagued the first half of season three- lots of talking, lots of exposition dump, information overload. It tells you A LOT of critical plot points and pieces of information all at once and it can be quite overwhelming to try to follow and sort through with the sheer volume it's shoving down your throat at one time. It wasn't quite as slow and boring as the first half of the season, possibly because there were fewer episodes of it, but the all talking no action final few episodes of this season were, once again, back to poorly paced mediocrity. As a whole, I still like Attack on Titan a lot and I'm certainly looking forward to the fourth and final season and seeing how it all ends for these characters, but I'm also an objective, older viewer and not a fanboy and I can call it as I see it and not slap a 10 on this because I'm caught up in the hype the way so many of you seem to be. This season was still worse than season one without a doubt in my mind, but I prefer it over season two even if only by a little bit.

INCREDIBLE) but i love seeing his gentler moments and also his pragmatic side as well. and hange is another standout for me, she always has been, with her unique balance of wackiness and warmth that doesn't feel forced. also armin!! i didn't realise it that much until this season but he has stepped up!! i like the trio of jean, connie and sasha as well, their interactions and also the way they keep things grounded for everyone. and although erwin was not amongst my top favourites, i appreciated his steadiness and calm demeanour throughout, and his final scenes were incredibly emotional to watch even eren has been through some interesting development - he started out hotheaded and with a drive like no other to defeat the titans and prove himself to himself, and now he has mellowed down a lot. almost become resigned. it's an interesting angle to take and i think it adds more to his character, that despite his motivations and all his efforts, the threats against them keep coming, and he is reaching his limits. and good old mikasa, she's SO badass and seeing her in action is great because she's so focused and skilled. her personality is still eren-centric but i think it has toned down a bit which is nice. the action in this series is amazing, it has been since the beginning. it's always been one of my favourite things about the show and this season was no different. there were so many intense action scenes and they were so dynamic and fluid and heart stopping and left me almost breathless by the end of them but i didn't want any of them to end. levi vs the beast titan, levi squad vs reiner and bertoldt, the cavalry charge. all brilliantly memorable scenes and all really well done there were a few other things that really stood out to me too. the first is the music, i thought it was really effective both when it played and when it didn't - there were some scenes with silence/very muted music in the background that worked wonders in creating atmosphere. another is the voice acting, it was FANTASTIC. all of the voice actors did a great job in conveying so many emotions, it really elevated the scenes. also i have to mention that the artwork of the backgrounds was very intricate and beautiful as well i have no idea how i expect myself to wait until december for season 4, and how i will wait a week between episodes. i'm also curious to see how the new studio tackles it. i want it all and i want it now. i wouldn't be surprised if i go back and rewatch this all because i just can't get enough of it --- watched from 14/11/2020 to 15/11/2020 ---",Season_3_Part_2

We started out as these teeny tiny humans inside these huge walls being attacked by this humongous titans to getting to know of this huge technologically advanced world which is prospering outside of these walls and this huge war between Marlyeans and Eldians that has led to this scenario! They really did decide to jump in head first. My eyes were literally glued to the screen, I couldnt take my eyes off. Personally, I love shows that build a great foundation in earlier seasons and then pick up the pace later on which is exactly what they've done so far. Shingeki no Kyojin has another layer of honesty and humanity added onto it by its strategic thinking and utilization of weaponry in Titans. Actual war plans and schemes are apparent, yet rarely feel cheap, as there is always meticulous planning and a keen eye for detail weaved into every element of the season. The pacing is stellar, with the 8 out of the 10 episodes adapting 2 chapters of the manga, and the other two episodes not feeling too dragged out. Heartfelt moments are executed brilliantly. Character arcs come to a satisfying close as new ones begin, and with the more emotional moments, tears will flow. Overall the story has come a long way from season 1 to Season 3 Part 2. The art and animation of this season was as stellar as it gets! That fight between Levi and Beast Titan which took approximately one month to make happened so quick and so smooth that i had to rewind it like 10 times to process what has happened. That smooth ODM Gear dynamic camera movement always make me awe. I dont know how they get that animation so perfectly! But despite having a fantastic animation, 3D colossal titan was poorly animated, its movements were not realistic and the contrast between 2D and 3D did not fit well. But the pros were so much that you will forget any minute cons in the animation. The OST is Magnificent! and Sawano is a genius. Every single one of his OSTs is a banger. From melancholy pieces for the sad moments to thrilling pieces for the epic moments, the Attack on Titan soundtrack remains one of the greatest; and the new tracks created for this season are no different. The sheer emotion one can feel from a track he created is simply amazing. The character development, My God no one can complain about this now! it has gone peeks and boundaries compared to season 1! We got to know about many characters a little bit more this season Like Grishas backstory and the amont of screentime that armin got as well as erwin got which made us understand those characters a little bit more was done well.  The Main MC Eren, who was criticized for being a screaming cry baby is now one of the most well-written characters in the series (and now in the manga he literally became one of my top characters of all time) Just like the story built up to this season, character arcs that have been built up also come to a conclusion, whether it be ending with their death or beginning to head in a new direction. So Finally Attack on titan is not something overly hyped, it has become incredible now, see Gigguks YT Video for your reference! Combining the epic moments, the jaw-dropping reveals, and emotional scenes, this season is a banger. It is the bangiest of bangers. How does one combine every possible outstanding thing an anime can do, into one anime? I don’t know, ask Isayama and WIT Studio. But this season achieves something truly great, making for one of the most enjoyable, outstanding and epic experiences you’ll ever have.

OKAMI_TAMA,10,"Jul 7, 2019",0/0,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS IN PARA 3 * So, here we are!!! After a seriously long period of wait we finally get the the season 3's part 2. Well to be very honest, i thought 10 episodes was too short a season to cover the Return to Shiganshina Arc, but they managed to pull it off nicely in those 10 episodes. WIT decided to change animations style this once a bit. I don't know of others but, the after seeing the animations in this season, the season was worth every moment of wait. Coming to story, we get many shocking revelations and answers in this season. Well, some answers raise ... new questions, If you are up to date with the manga you will know what I am talking of. Anime only people, I commend you for resisting and not reading the manga. Well, this arc was a major turning point in the manga, it is in the anime as well. The scenes are as beautiful as you would expect (possibly much more than that). The Eren Vs. Reiner fights are lit as hell. Eren has gottten so good at his hardening ability. My only problem being, why did Levi choose Armin over Erwin for the power of the Colossal Titan. Erwin is much much more better than Armin as he has will to sacrifice and has much more experience than him. I seriously would have loved to see Erwin as the Colosssal Titan. All that said, the season is a total blockbuster! IF you haven't watched it, go WATCH IT!! It's worth every penny! Thank You for reading this.",Season_3_Part_2
paranoid_soul,10,"Jun 29, 2020",0/0,"I left a glowing review for Season 3 part 1. Just when I thought AoT couldn't get any better, it proved me wrong. This season not only delivered the same quality as the previous part, but it also went above and beyond by setting a standard for succeeding animes. It will be very hard for any show to balance both story and action while reaching the emotional level that SnK S2 P2 was able to reach. Story: Return to Shiganshina arc gives us what we have always been waiting for - the revelation of what is inside Eren's basement, and boy it doesn't disappoint. ... The battle against the Titans to get there is full of suspenseful mind game, clever strategies, and of course, amazing actions. I watched every single episode with bated breath, anticipating what was going to happen next. Yet, amidst all the excitement of action sequences, the show still manages to move us to tears with the sacrifices that our protagonists have to make to ensure victory for mankind. The secret to the basement has been unlocked, and it opens up a whole new intricate story of the oppressed versus the oppressor, power corruption, greed, and so much more. The story so far has been pretty simple - ""we are the prey and they are the hunters."" We know there is something more lurking in the background. We know there are people vying for power and hiding the truth. What I didn't expect is how complex yet realistic the truth is. It shows how the oppressed can quickly become the oppressor once they grab hold of power. It is a painful portrayal of how power can corrupt a person's soul. Character: Season 3 is when you become completely invested in the characters. In this season, Erwin, Armin, Levi and later on, Eren, definitely take the spotlight. While Erwin and Armin, the two greatest minds of mankind, have to face the difficult choice between living to see their dreams fulfilled and dying for the sake of mankind, Captain Levi face the decision of who to revive, his friend and the experienced Erwin, or Armin, the young brilliant mind with great zest left for life. Isayama managed to make a hero out of all these characters while making them extremely human. They are complicated beings with paradoxical thoughts, and Levi, in making his final irrational yet reasonable decision, showcases this. Meanwhile, our protagonist Eren has changed so much at the end of the season upon learning the truth about the enemies that you cannot recognize he is the same person as the boy who screamed and shouted and tried to kill all the Titans he saw in Season 1. Besides the protagonists, Reiner and Bertholdt have the opportunity to display their humane side as well. The audience cannot help but sympathize with these young warriors who are victims of their government. Their farewell scene where these two buddies wish each other good luck broke me. Little details such as Bertholdt being relieved and happy in his disoriented state upon seeing Eren's squad as he still confused them for his allies shows how he truly considered them friends. Alas, this show is one of the very few shows that make me unable to decide who to cheer for. Sound: Sawano went God-mode with the soundtrack. Enough said. If you have yet to watch this masterpiece of a season, I implore you, please do. You will NOT regret it.",Season_3_Part_2
Candycanes02,10,"Jul 18, 2021",0/0,"I'm 25 years old. I am half-Japanese, so I watched a bunch of anime growing up. Yet, Attack on Titan surpasses any of the anime I've watched and is my favorite. I am not sure this anime can be valued as highly by people that don't do fiction writing as a career or hobby, but as someone who does it for a hobby, my admiration of Isayama as an author is off the charts. I would love to write a book about why AoT is so well-written, but I don't think that's necessary for people who have watched the show and have been pleasantly surprised by ... the many plot twists that happened to all be connected in a meaningful, logical way. If you're a fan of world-building, 3D characters, and an immersive story, you will not be disappointed by Attack on Titan. If you just want characters to be badass all the time and don't want the sappy feelings and internal struggles, you won't really enjoy the whole experience.",Season_3_Part_2
Ethan_07,9,"Aug 1, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, ever since it kicks off way back then, has employed one of the oldest trick in the book of element of surprises. It builds a solid and harmony foundation that's been sustained for 100+ years and then at the very beginning, it crushed this to dust. But it doesn't stop there. Again, and again, it spiced up the story with more twists and bamboozled everyone with more questions than answers that we are revealed to. Emotional torture increasing level by level, deaths piling up after deaths, with far too many good people and loveable characters die for no good reason. This makes ... one could not help but wonder - was it all worth it? - Damn right, it was. This was shoved right into the face of those who intended to drop the series. The explanation to all the unknown intention of Titans, their origins and what is beyond those tall stone walls are revealed one by one, bits by bits are uncovered. Everything that has happened to them so far has brought an impact to how the characters develop, how they perceive the world and how they intend to save it. Looking back to the actions and ideal of some of the characters, especially Commander Erwin, every dots are connected as a whole. You understand why Levi made that decision, you empathize with the tears dropped by their comrades that turned Titan and most importantly, you miss the old days that they shared. It's as if you're by their side witnessing everything, all the way to the end of it. This has just brought a realisation to how brilliant the foreshadowing was and the build up of the story with the characters' perspective, not only the decimating events with hordes of Titans. There is this bond between them that is inextinguishable, and thus, the choices they have to make are the ones that resemble them, not just for the sake of the plot. This eventually rise the emotions to the peak at one particular point. A choice with the strongest will. All in all, this season and this part of Shingeki no Kyojin has dealt a great impact to the whole franchise. As it marks the end of their struggle, it only highlights the beginning of their real journey .. against the world.",Season_3_Part_2
lekuchi,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"All I can say is, “Wow, what a season.” While I thought that Attack on Titan was already a great show, as a non manga reader I thought that the story would reach a dead end soon as the show looked like it was going to hit the climax with this season in the taking of Wall Maria. But boy was I wrong. Along with some of the best action we’ve seen from the show, we get to see amazing world building that is able to raise the stakes of an already tense and epic show. The reveals that this season brings very well changes ... the show from a battle shonen to one that has a lot more potential to delve deeper into the characters as well as the world of Attack on Titan. I just really loved the direction that this story was able to take. We get to see the siege on Wall Maria, the climax we as fans have been waiting for since it was brutally taken in the first episode. But even after we get to see the stakes that these characters have to endure in the future of this story, which I thought has made this show even more interesting. We go from a incredible action oriented battle to a somber and pretty dark tone that the show is known for but it’s done in a better and more interesting way then just giving characters a tragic backstory to overcome which we have seen in many shonen. The world building this show gave this season rather gives more reason and understanding on what these characters are fighting for, not just to destroy the Titans but rather to fight for their freedom. Besides this, we get some of the OST from AoT like Symphonic Suite Part 5 and 6. Like this is some incredible and epic OST. Along with this we get some incredible animation. While I dislike CGI in anime I thought it looked great here on the the Colossal Titan. In terms of character development we don’t get much from the main cast in the beginning but rather they get it from the reveals that the 2nd half of the season brings. Overall, this has been the best season of Attack on Titan and I’m incredibly excited for what this anime can bring. I’m reluctant to read the manga because I want to experience it in its full animation glory but I might just say fuck it and read it anyway. I heard that Wit Studios won’t be animating AoT anymore which is shame, but I’m sure Production I.G can do a great job as well. But goddamn, what. a. season.",Season_3_Part_2
Zeldro,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"These 10 episodes have been built up to since episode 1 - it is the defining arc of Attack on Titan. The entire story of this anime comes together here. It has the hype of S1, the intense mystery of S2, and the interesting political intrigue of S3A (in the latter episodes mind you) - and then adds a layer of its own. Does it live up to the hype? The ridiculously high score given by the users of MAL, contrasting to the other seasons of AoT? Yes. Story - 10 Again, this is what the rest of the series has been building up to. Cruel fates are ... met by friends and foes alike; emotional turmoil runs rampant; hidden truths are unveiled; and mindblowing moments are everywhere. The writing is stellar. See, build-up has to payoff in order for the story to work, otherwise it isn’t even build-up - because if the culmination of everything isn’t satisfying, the series itself isn’t satisfying. This season delivers on everything it has presented to you thus far. The basement isn’t some last-episode-of-the-series, far off plot point anymore, it’s a main focus now. The Colossal Titan is no longer some “big baddie” you see once in a while who then runs off, as this is the ultimate battle with him. Mindgames and in-depth battle tactics are everywhere. How major players are defeated simply makes sense - and the characters use what they already have at their disposal to achieve their goal. This arc has the most big-name deaths, not just side character deaths - and yes, plot armor is still there, but it mostly makes sense as to why a certain character survived (except for one character - a villain, though). The payoff near the end of the season is unparalleled. I don’t want to go in-depth because of spoilers, but the world of Attack on Titan is expanded beautifully. You will, without a doubt, have to rewatch certain episodes to make sure you got the full gist of everything, because new information will hit you like a brick, but it all just makes sense. The basement lives up to the hype. It will destroy your mind. The pacing is stellar, with the 8 out of the 10 episodes adapting 2 chapters of the manga, and the other two episodes not feeling too dragged out. Heartfelt moments are executed brilliantly. Character arcs come to a satisfying close as new ones begin, and with the more emotional moments, tears will flow. Negatives, as far as story goes, would have to be a certain villain’s frustrating plot armor and the possibility of being left completely confused after an information-heavy episode. Art - 9 There is a battle sequence that took about a month to animate, and it is one of the most jaw-dropping moments of the series. I really hope WIT stays with Attack on Titan, because they are perfect for this series. The backgrounds, especially in the latter episodes, are astonishingly breathtaking; scenes without said backgrounds would not be nearly as hard-hitting. However, it is not entirely perfect, which is why it receives a 9 rather than a 10: it is inconsistent. Even within the best-animated episodes are a few wonky-looking animations, lazy hair movements, and ODM sequences that just feel… off. It’s only on occasion and is more prevalent in episodes 2-5, getting better as it goes along. Along with that is the dreaded CGI Colossal Titan. It can look downright atrocious at times. Other times, it looks fine, and when it is properly animated in 2D, it looks great. But, again, the pros vastly outweigh the cons in this area, and it’s still an upgrade from the latter half of season 2 when every other shot was a still. Sound - 10 Sawano is a genius. Every single one of his OSTs is a banger. From melancholy pieces for the sad moments to thrilling pieces for the hype moments, the Attack on Titan soundtrack remains one of the greatest; and the new tracks created for this season are no different. The sheer emotion one can feel from a track he created is simply amazing. Voice acting is superb, well, the Japanese VAs anyway. I remember one scene that chose a haunting silence instead of a soundtrack coupled with amazing voice acting, making for some very tense moments that fill you with goosebumps. Character - 10 One of the biggest complaints from S1 is now completely gone. This area has progressively gotten better over the series, and arcs that began long ago come to a conclusion in this season. Characters previously thought to be one-note throwaways are now complex human beings that see things differently from everybody else. The main protagonist, Eren, who was criticized for being a cliche screaming “I want to achieve X” MC is now one of the most well-written characters in the series. Just like the story built up to this season, character arcs that have been built up also come to a conclusion, whether it be ending with their death or beginning to head in a new direction. Enjoyment - 10 Combining the hype moments, the jaw-dropping reveals, and the tearjerkers, this season is a banger. It is the bangiest of bangers. How does one combine every possible amazing thing an anime can do, into one anime? I don’t know, ask Isayama and WIT. But this season achieves something truly great, making for one of the most enjoyable experiences you’ll ever have. Overall - 10 Did you watch S1 and drop it? Understandable, I guess. S1 was nothing special - it was GOOD, but compared to this… I don’t want to insult S1, but this is just in another league entirely. Watch it. Watch this season and then rewatch to pick up on all of the hints and foreshadowing for the reveals this season has to offer. Watch Attack on Titan.",Season_3_Part_2
claretravels,10,"Jun 17, 2020",0/0,"SnK Season 3 (Part 2) is the result of an anime that has always shined brightly while unable to fully hide various flaws, becoming polished to absolute perfection. The story is fast-paced and is heavy on the action, making up for where it lacked in Part 1. The sense of foreboding in episode 1 is palpable. The early episodes really do a great job of reinforcing your hatred for the villains; I didn't think it was possible to hate the trio of traitors any more than I already did, but a harrowing flashback in episode 3 actually achieves this! The Beast titan is as detestable, smug, ... and ugly as ever. The relentless battle of the first half is equal parts thrilling and devastating. Erwin's charge is a moment showcasing the anime's emotional core: desperate hope in the face of insurmountable odds. And episode 6 is perhaps my favourite episode in all of SnK so far...the choice presented feels absolutely gut-wrenching for all involved, and I think the episode is done just perfectly. The remaining episodes are the most satisfying of the whole series and finally begin to unravel the mysteries of the SnK world, incorporating a pretty harrowing story in flashback form. It's been a long time coming, and it's well worth the wait. The characterisation has only continued to get stronger from season to season. In Part 2 the greatest standout to me is Armin, a boy who has been consistently proving himself as a smart and valuable ally throughout SnK but who had remained a little underrated by his peers, fully blossoms in this season and it's beautiful to watch. Erwin and Levi shine brightly as well. My opinion on the sound and the art is unchanged from previous seasons: the music is fine. The animation is outstandingly brilliant. Kudos. Overall, I enjoyed Part 3 the most of any season to date. Previous seasons have always been strong but have consistently had setbacks too; whereas I think Part 3 really nails every element. The action, the pacing, the significant emotional gut-punching, the exposition, the final scenes...this anime is a joy to watch, and makes me giddy with anticipation for the final season.",Season_3_Part_2
potbrick,9,"Oct 25, 2020",0/0,"Building on twelve full episodes of setup, the second half of Attack on Titan's third season sees us return to the place that started it all, as the Survey Corps enter the city of Shiganshina, where they hope to finally access Grisha Yeager's basement and accede to his request to carry on his mission and to unravel the great secrets of their world. In the process, the series transforms itself into a completely different tale and sets the stage to what will undoubtedly be an amazing final season. After years of lovingly recreating mangaka Hajime Isayama's artwork, WIT Studio surpasses itself and delivers some of the ... greatest action scenes in the medium, perfectly capturing the large yet intimate scale of Titan battles. Particular praise has to go to the final confrontation with the Beast Titan, which is crafted with so much love and passion from the studio and the cast that it almost defies comprehension. Speaking of the voice cast, they all rise to the occasion in their finest collective effort yet. Yuki Kaji as Eren continues to deliver an impossibly passionate performance that proves his undying committment to the character. But the highlight of the season has to be Daisuke Ono as Erwin Smith, who truly shines this season and cements his place in the pantheon of legendary shounen characters. Sadly the same cannot be said of the entire cast. Mikasa continues to get shafted incredibly hard by Isayama, as by this point she is nothing but an extension of Eren's character, which especially stings this season now that other major cast members such as Erwin, Armin and Levi have gotten their own moments in the spotlight. And finally, special mention must go to Hange, who is absolutely precious. While they are not the best character in the series, she is incredibly enjoyable and unique. The fact that she and the other senior members of the Resistance (Levi, Zachary, etc.) aren't treated as saints and are given moral complexity only adds to this enjoyment. One of the best mystery stories I've ever experienced, Part 2 doubles as a great exploration of how legacies of hatred are passed down from one generation to the next, and how we are all nothing but products of much larger systems of oppression that we must desperately fight against throughout our entire lives, lest they repeat themselves for eternity. The stage is now set for a game-changing fourth and final season, and I could not be more hopeful.",Season_3_Part_2

dakuchonekobing,8,"Apr 6, 2023",0/0,"The first 5 eps is great about emotions, the second 5 eps is logical and explanatory. It can be said that part 2 of season 3 is a special case, I can divide these 10 eps into two parts. Part 1: Battle of Shiganshina Indeed this is what I expect from AOT. Both season 2 and part 1 of season 3, at the climax, I still feel those battles have not reached the level of excitement as season 1, but here things are different. The battle with the Beast Titan at Shiganshina was so dramatic, thrilling every second and made me unable to take my eyes off the ... screen. The fighting scenes between survey corps and titans are not only good in terms of action but also in terms of war tactics. The characters all have their own moments. There are some very interesting characters, so their ending makes me feel sad. I was expecting a more epic ending for those characters. The music is really the bright spot, I'm always immersed in the atmosphere of the story very quickly. After the battle ended, I was waiting for the next eps to explode, so I had expectations. Part 2: Explanations for the Mysteries If someone was waiting for the tunes of the final episodes to be as dramatic as the battle at Shiganshina, they'd be a bit disappointed. This stage describes the aftermath of the war and the secrets are revealed. It can be said that the tempo of these eps is slower and softer. The story of the mystery of the titans is explained quite reasonably, especially with the ""important key"" details connected to the previous seasons, I really like these two points. However, everything is too exciting in the first eps, so when the story of the other world is described, everything becomes new and the viewer will have to try to remember new words, new concepts, and accidentally lost the drama inherent in the first eps. After all, the past is only for explaining the question. The flashbacks are the whole episode length reveal the mysteries, and I have said in the previous reviews, the mystery is revealed, the attractiveness is only at a ratio of 50/50. I have a lot of respect for the stories about titan that the author tried to bring to explain the world of AOT. But no matter how hard I try, the appeal of this answer cannot be maintained at the level of the eps talk about the current battle - Shiganshina. In particular, although the supporting characters and main characters are impressive to some extent, the only thing missing from this season is the interaction between the characters, I mean the love between them. This has not yet been shown convincingly. The characters behave too mechanically, talking only about plans, heroism, and battles, instead of gestures of intimacy or concern for one another. The part where Eren-Historia interacts in the field is a short romance, it's too little compared to the number of young boys and girls in the story. And in the end, the main character is put into a sluggish, miserable mood, no longer connected with people. Right now, love is the only thing that brings the character to good, but this is inherently rare from the beginning. Art is not the highlight, compared to season 1. The ending brings many facts, many strange concepts about war, between one race and another, instead of bringing the viewer into a state of emotional satisfaction. If anyone is looking forward to a complicated story, many questions want to be answered, here are 10 eps worth enjoying. If anyone just wants to see exciting battles, heroic characters, they will prefer the first 5 eps.",Season_3_Part_2
Luckheart,10,"Oct 23, 2020",0/0,"Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2 is the genuine high point for the series. In a surprising turn, there isn't a whole lot I dislike about this season. The art direction, acting, music, sound and sequences are start-to-finish perfect. The only gripes I have with this season is the introduction of elements that were not previously established (you'll know when you see them.) The lack of foreshadowing for these elements, or at least establishing them prior, which is possible because the manga was far past this area when the anime was being made. Regardless, these elements are only momentarily jarring and overall, this Season ... is the best sequence of Attack on Titan we ever got.",Season_3_Part_2
jojo_golden_5,8,"Nov 18, 2020",0/0,"Attack on Titans has got to be one of the best anime series that I have ever seen. Since the beginning, the series has created an exponential amount of hype and this season has kept up with that expectation. This section was one of the most hyped chunks of episodes I have ever seen. Every single episode left me on the edge of my seat and wanting more. It killed me to patiently wait every week for the next episode to air. Everything that the series has offered so far has been phenomenal: from the incredible world-building, the developments of the character's personalities, the animation ... direction, to the incredible original soundtrack. As someone who has read the manga for this part of the series, I can say that the anime stayed loyal to the original source material. I applaud WIT studios for their amazing work on the animation! You can definitely tell that they went all out this season and that took an incredible amount of care into their work. The soundtrack has got to be one of the best soundtracks that I have ever heard in an anime. The immense hype I get from listening to “ətˈæk 0N tάɪtn” is unreal! Finally, we see that our characters have grown so much from their season 1 counterparts. Every action and event that has occurred in the previous season has changed our characters and it is shown through their actions and decisions.

meltdog,10,"Mar 30, 2021",0/0,"This is easily my favorite part of AOT. I don’t have much to say about it other than that it’s perfect. This season alone is a reason why you should watch AOT. A lot of the characters including Armin, Erwin, Levi, Zeke, and even Jean show tremendous development and have some pretty awesome moments. It’s an action packed 10 episodes and most certainly has the best arc (imo) up to this point. The Return to Shiganshina is what all viewers waited for and I would hate to hear that anyone was disappointed about it. Biased or unbiased, I believe this season is a 10/10.

tele_fon,10,"Aug 1, 2023",0/0,"THIS, this is where Attack on Titan reached masterpiece for me. The show finally crossed the line of amazing thrill and shocking moments to ""investing"". In an arc filled with big battle scenes, the best episodes were deeply psychological. I enjoy the battle strategies of this arc, so much big brain energy on all sides. I love the theme of owning up to one decision with no regrets that the show explored, each choice revealed each character's essence. How in a war, you will end up losing something, but choosing what to lose is also a big part of survival. It really elevate the conflict ... in each scene. The arc also finally provide us the satisfaction of learning the ""truth"" and the consequences of obtaining it. Sometimes that might not you free, and you can feel the weight of that on the characters. You know the world change from this point forward, and it just bring so much excitement and dread. Top 3 characters this season: Eren (The hell this boy has been through. Eren's forever change by the truth, with his whole believe system being stripped down.), Hanji (She's been one of my favorite characters on the show as an advocate for progress, but she also hold the scout together emotionally here.), Floch (Probably controversial yet I think he adds so much depth to AOT. We've only seen the story from our main cast POV and have our bias, but as an outsider, he was the one affected by their choices without being able to choose.)",Season_3_Part_2

In its current state it is the show that fanboys and fangirls made the series out to be. I'm not sure if it was because of where the series ended up in the manga or because WIT had like 5 years to make 2 ... half seasons, but I guess we'll see in retrospect when season 4 gets picked up by a new studio?

Attack on titan isn't the kind of anime to waste it's time on filler episodes. It never ever had an episode which never progressed the story. I never felt bored watching it nor rewatching it and nor will i ever be to sum up , stop seeing review and go watch the best anime ever",Season_3_Part_2
CrusaderElly,9,"Jul 2, 2019",0/0,"What a twist! Attack on titan was pretty hype, then it died down a bit, third season was fine, but this final part sure kicks it up a notch! What I loved the most, in no particular order: - The music, but that's always been a strong point. - Characters making logical decisions! :o There's still a lot of crazy stuff and plot convenience like every anime, but in this case there are several points where you expect an anime trope, but instead, the characters act rationally, quickly, and without mercy. Good! - Beautiful choreography! - Consequences for actions taken! I wish more characters had died as a result of their ... actions, but the fact that some did is a good step in the right direction. - Good animation! Way good in fact! - Aaand finally, a bunch of questions are getting answered, the BBG gets introduced (maybe?), and it feels like the plot is going somewhere! All in all, I felt very satisfied after viewing this season, which sets up some neat things, delves into some backstory, has powerful and logical action scenes, some emotional scenes, and a good send-off. If you've been sticking with AoT this long, definitely watch it!",Season_3_Part_2
Awoo4U,8,"Nov 21, 2020",0/0,"Story It was as if the previous seasons was just the development needed for a big payoff during this season, The pacing is a lot better this time around. Exposition and action happen more frequently to keep you entertained. The lore is explored much more throughly in this part than in the other parts. The lore is deep, but not hard to understand or interpret. Plenty of edge of your seats moments as well. Easily the best season thus far Art Great artwork and animation especially during battles Sound Better than the first part of season 3, but not super memorable Character Way more development this time around than in the previous ... seasons.

PixlReality,9,"Nov 9, 2019",0/0,"This review is for *both* the first and second half's of season 3. I find it hard to believe that we're nearing the end of this amazing series. Attack on Titan has been an anime that I've been following since it's debut back in 2013, and it's been a wild ride since then. First season was immensely popular and enthralling, while the second left more to be desired. However, after finishing this season, and finally putting the puzzle pieces together, I'm sure that this season is by far the most emotionally compelling yet. And I cannot stress this enough, but this season in particular showed ... some of the best character development among all three so far, specifically in Eren. To conclude this short review, I find it hard to not give this season a 10/10. However with the fourth season coming next year, I'm sure that one will hit those numbers. This season also had some amazing sound design and epic openers. Art-style is still kicking too. All in all though, I HIGHLY recommend you giving this a watch if you're even slightly intrigued with AOT at all (If there's one thing however, that they could have done better, it's not splitting S3 into two parts).",Season_3_Part_2

kyo_04,9,"Oct 12, 2023",0/0,"You want to know the truth so bad but is it really worth it? Will knowing it fulfill your desire of destroying the unknown instead of living in ignorance? The 3rd season of Shingeki no Kyojin had me in a chokehold. I was gasping for air throughout every episode. Yearning for the truth to be revealed but as soon as I knew what was going on, it's like it's not worth knowing it anymore. Just like Eren, Mikasa and Armin were saying : ""Will it bring back the old days?"" And the answer is obviously, no. Beyond the fact that the plot is incredibly well written, ... I still think that there were moments where we could have turned the situation around (for example when the choice of revival was made, why not split the liquid and revive both since as seen before, Historia's father only had a small sip of it.) Grisha Jaeger... What a man. I'm at loss of words and can't wait to see how Eren will change from all the memories he'll live. Now the soundtrack does its job perfectly but I do think the openings are... Good. I know it's almost as if there's no flaw but, there really almost isn't. The art is what I appreciate the most though. The shading, the colors, the line art... Everything is so well thought on each frame that I'm left speechless (except for the colossal titan... that CGI didn't age well but honestly it's not that bad, just not as perfect as the rest.) I can't say I'm happy about the loss we experienced during this season but, I'm pleased that one character finally brought up the darkest side of humanity which we rarely see THIS strong. When all we see are brave soldiers that may doubt themselves here and there, we got to stay in touch with how surreal everything is. We need a reminder that, the protagonists are human beings facing such a terrifying situation. And this season does the job well. Just to add a bit more to how the story evolves, I think it was very fast but again this is pretty much how SNK works so... The fact that we can't digest anything and just have to live through it all is a ""good"" thing to me. It's like we're one of the characters. Though I do think that the truth should have been made clearer because it's pretty messy. And because of that, some points aren't getting across us, so please watch multiple times if needed. Was it a good season? Of course. Would I go through it again? Yeah, I'm into emotional rollercoasters. Recommend? OBVIOUSLY!",Season_3_Part_2
SkritSkrot,10,"May 20, 2021",0/0,"I think the entirety of season 3 (Pt.1 & Pt.2) was my favorite season. Like any other show, season 3 of Shingeki no Kyojin had its flaws, but overall it was really good. The animation was beautiful, the way you could tell the characters had gotten older was amazing. The plot was great, at this point it was no longer about fighting Titans, but discovering the truth. The action was great, throughout the entirety of season three there was a good balance between combat and emotional scenes, none of the times getting you bored. Several unexpected plot twists. The thing I love about all seasons of ... snk, is that the majority of characters, whether or not they get killed off, have importance besides backing up the protagonist. Like Ymir, even if they didn’t show her much, they still showed her past and her relationships, making us see how Great of a character she was. 10/10 would recommend.",Season_3_Part_2

UnReaLzx,10,"Jun 21, 2019",0/0,"English is not my native language, so if you find some mistakes im sorry in advance. My review will contain minor spoilers, but i just feel the need to expose my opinion about this anime, because is just a master piece. Ive watched hundreds of animes in the last decade. There are out there many good animes, but trust me: NOTHING like this season of Shingeki no Kyojin. If you never watched this series, Stop reading and GO WATCH. The anime as a whole is pretty damn good, but this season its a MASTER PIECE, i repeat. Its the ectasy of the series , all the mistery ... and tension you have been building this past years are all in big BANGGGGG mod, exploding in your face, again and again and again and you are just WOW , hits you in the face and all makes sense now ( i dont read Mangas). The history is just amazing, the characters some of them you love and they die, bad guys , good guys they are all GREAT, you cheer for the good to win 90% of the time, but even the ""bad guys"" ( because good and evil in this anime gets a bit complicated, they have all their own reasons to do things, they all do what they believe is right) you get attached to all of them, they all have their emotions, their feelings, their reasons! And sometimes you find yourself lost on whos side you are at. The animation ive never seen ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, the colossal titan gets a bit clumsy, thats the only NO NO NO this season, but the overall is soo good that you say fak the colossal titan and YES YES YES! Music really gets you in the mood, amazing soundtrack. Enjoyment? Fak me. You are at your fakin seat like "" when is this dude dying? When is that girl dying, or you are like YEAH!!! and then in one second: NOOOOO!!"" man, you never know. The tension, the drama, it just kicks your ass. And its revelation after revelation, throwbacks that explain what you have been missing all along , they know how to do things. The speed of the anime is just perfect. No Fillers, no bullshits, like lets make money and money NARUTO Style for example or lets ruin the rest of the series ""premature ejaculation style pace"" like the second part of Deathnote, its just perfectly paced.

All amazing and top tier in quality. If you haven't seen this yet, then I strongly recommend you start it immediately. The intricacies of the plot are unlike anything I have ever watched. Just when you think you know what will happen next, the story completely throws you for a loop.

Hammel,10,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"Shingeki no Kyojin started catching many people with that interesting concept of giants, walls and brave young people. Even in the first episodes, it started surprising everyone. The plot was giving a hint that it was not just another anime. I watch anime since I was four years old and my ''top 5'' was very safe until I met SNK. But now, guys, the thing just got serious. At this point, in season 3 part 2, the world that was built so far is showing that it deserves not only a place in the top 5, but in the top 1. Everybody knows that the ... drawing and the OST are awesome, they always were, but the plot is getting to levels that I couldn't even imagine that an anime could. If you're reading this, WATCH SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN. I began season 3 part 2 already with this feeling, and as I finished it, I am sure that what the plot is preparing is something that will surprise us again. That's what this show always do. But this time, at the final season, if they do it right, SNK can become the greatest of all time. I am not a newbie, I have watched almost everything that people claimed to be the best. And I have a lot of prejudice with SNK. I will keep the 10/10 to sound and art, because I don't think they got better, it was always perfect. However, they seem better now because the PLOT is getting to absurd levels and that ""marriage"" can get beyond the 10. No more words. Watch this. Let's wait for the final season and hope they finish it with the necessary effort that this Masterpiece deserve. Only a tragedy could ruin this.",Season_3_Part_2
Graine,5,"Oct 20, 2021",0/0,"The review as a whole will contain spoilers for the previous seasons. I usually try to avoid spoilers, but this time, the problems are so directly related to the story that I have to address some of the plot elements. Those that have seen the previous parts of the show are safe for now. I will give a warning until I get to the spoilers for Season 3 Part 2. I actually loved the beginning of S3P2. The first six episodes, for me, were as good as the show has gotten since season 1. We are finally taking back Wall Maria. We will finally get to ... know the mystery of the cellar. We get the hyped up confrontation with the Armored and Colossal Titans - the one's that started it all. And the ruined district of Shiganshina is the perfect venue for this climactic confrontation. Seeing it again felt really cathartic. During the previous chapters, I almost forgot how satisfying it can be to be dealing with something that has been properly built up and not just hastily thrown at the wall with the hopes of it sticking. The battle of Shiganshina has a lot of great things going on. Bunch of great heroic moments and lots of incredibly over the top, brutal, action. The beast titan is hurling boulders baseball pitcher style. The Colossal Titan can cause something akin to a nuclear explosion upon transforming now. Much of it is stupid, but it's stupid in the most entertaining way possible. We get epic heroic speeches. Moments of sacrifice. Couple of anticlimactic deaths too, to remind us that it's not all roses and heroism on the battlefield. Very Attack on Titan. The entire injector dilemma was a brilliant and tense sequence. It was so good that I find it difficult to accept that it emerged from the same mind that came up with the atrocious Reiss family story and thought it wouldn't damage the setting. In a vacuum, the battle of Shiganshina is a lot fun. What drags it down, is that it is constantly climbing uphill after what the previous chapters did to the story as a whole. But over all, I would definitely recommend the first six episodes to anyone who has gotten this far into the show - there is no reason to stop before experiencing this. And then they ruin it. And by ""it"", I mean everything. A lot of dumb stuff happened during Season 2 and S3P1. But it was all still very tolerable. It could have been fixed... or at least you kept telling yourself that. But this was not only the last nail into the story's coffin, as far as I'm concerned, it was also enough dirt to bury the whole thing 6 feet under. ==SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT== The entire world we have seen so far, is actually a secluded island. Beyond the ocean, there is an evil mega nation of doom that are persecuting an ancient race of people that once commanded the power of the titans. Their preferred method of execution for the descendants of these titans is to inject them with titan juice and set them loose on the island to terrorize the people living inside the walls. The Evil mega nation of doom, that are now being set up as the primary antagonists, are after the vast amounts of natural resources that can be found on the island. That's the spark behind it all! The nazis want some oil! If this sounds incredibly stupid to you... it's because I'm bastardizing it to hell... But also because IT IS! So, it all took place on an island. We got characters with split personalities. Characters with very selective amnesia. Memory altering magic powers. Inconsistent magic powers that inexplicably work on some people while being useless against others. When your story has elements such as these, you know you are dealing with quite a mess. There are some satisfying revelations here and there but they don't outweigh the tremendous amounts of awful. Also, every new bit of information we have learned about the titans as the show has progressed, has made them less and less cool. What happened to the ""grim reminder"" the mankind received at the beginning of the show? Living in fear of the titans? By the end of season 3 the characters are talking like the titans aren't even a factor anymore. And they are right! The titans are meaningless. In fact, they kill off all the titans! They JUST do it! Killing off ALL the regular titans, the once insurmountable enemy of mankind, isn't even deserving of a montage. Not even a dialogue scene. It's a passing sentence. One of the most horrific monsters ever created - reduced to this. To wrap it up... The first 6 episodes of the season are a lot of fun. They are what drag my score for the season a little higher than it probably should be, considering the dreadful plot revelations in the final episodes.",Season_3_Part_2
Shumi_Reviews,9,"Feb 3, 2024",0/0,"IMDB, one of the largest film and tv review sites, has a top episode list made by the collective score the users have given each episode, just like how we do it on MAL. Among the top 10 episodes there are three episodes from AOT s3 part 2. I’d say that is pretty impressive. This season of Attack on Titan is pretty jam packed with action. A lot of revelations come to pass, and a lot of things come to an end. Plot/characters: First this season has some of the highest adrenaline action in all of anime, everything is so well done. There’s not a ... single movement and every scene is amazingly memorable. The second half of the season reveals more about the world, and it feels like a conclusion to the titan story, again it is very well done with scenes of good character conflict, revelations and closing. Animation: Top notch like always. This anime is crowded with fight scenes with amazing animation and the second half has some tranquil scenes which are well designed. Sound/Ost: The music is top notch, a lot of the old melodies repeat from season one, the music really helps boost the action scenes to the next level. Sad piano instrumental tracks during character’s monologue, amazing raging orchestral tracks during charge scenes and emotional strings during sad scenes have been well utilized. Overall, this was peak Attack on Titan and peak anime. A very satisfying season to watch and a nice conclusion to a great chapter of the story.",Season_3_Part_2
ghier,10,"Oct 17, 2024",0/0,"This is amazing. Truly. It is not just another show with one or two impressive moments. It’s one that has developed many evocative characters with their own purpose and directly pitted those motivations ... their life ambitions ... against the need for their sacrifice in the battle to come. It has built my anticipation of the mysteries to be revealed only to completely surpass my expectations at the reveal. It reinforced themes so tragic and so reminiscent of the real world that it brings tears to my eyes. It swept me up on a roller coaster of emotions with the many twists and turns in a ... fated epic battle ... for which I had no idea what would happen. It has fantastic direction that recognizes all these strong elements in its story and knows exactly how to convey them onscreen. And with music that sends chills down your spine, or completely invigorates you … timed perfectly with dialogue to make you feel the same emotions as those in the story. I … I just can’t even. It’s incredible. It is the definitive GOAT of climaxes in television. There is not a single show out there that has packed so much, so many incredible moments in 10 episodes: that’s 3 hours and 20 minutes of runtime not counting OPs and EDs. Just think about all those 3-hour movies nowadays that almost never justify the runtime. Compare how you feel watching those to this. Can you believe we really got something like this in entertainment? Will we ever get something else like it again? … I write this in retrospective of my immense disappointment with the “final season” of Attack on Titan. Given what was achieved in season 3 part 2, the sequel to it would always disappoint in one way or another. Rewatching Attack on Titan up to this point after finishing the whole series has made me realize that … I was wrong to say Attack on Titan won’t be well remembered because of its ending. At the very least, I’ll remember this show for the rest of my life because of this climax. Beyond just how amazing it is, the themes connected with me on a personal level, specifically because the view of the world presented in Attack on Titan matches my view of the world. I grew up a naïve person and remain that way at heart and act as such without even realizing it. I want to believe that things can work out if people are honest with one another and have that heart-to-heart … and that the world can be a better place if so. But the reality is, people often just won’t do it. And even if they do, one enemy to another, have that heart-to-heart, it’d be a miracle for things to just work out. Now, instead of two people, one country is in conflict with another. Imagine the near-impossible difficulty in having a true heart-to-heart with another country … with all the complexities of diplomacy and politics … all the deep seated hatred from prior wars. And imagine realizing the suffering you would inflict upon others in war should diplomacy fail. It’s a world of hopelessness with a desperate struggle to hold on to optimism. And realize, this isn’t just Attack on Titan. It is the real world.",Season_3_Part_2
FakeWeeb10,10,"Jan 17, 2024",0/0,"(I have added all seasons to my personal anime list, and each season will get the same review from me, so I apologize if you have seen this more than once or are about to see this more than once.) When watching a lot of other anime as a new watcher, I had a really hard time getting into a lot of them because for me it was so incredibly easy to predict the plot. For some reason I was always able to tell just how an anime was going to end or in which direction it was headed. That was not the case for ... this show. Every plot twist caught me almost completely off guard. All questions that got answered as the series lead on only lead to more questions that sucked me even deeper into the show. Every aspect of this story was extremely well written from the very beginning to the very end. Going along with the incredible writing, all of the characters are also extremely well written. The speeches given throughout the series and character development that evolves over time will give you chills. Everyone in this anime developed so much and in such a good way for the plot since the beginning. Everything was lined up perfectly for the story to make sense the way it was done. The animation and scenery is also not something to sneeze at. The first few seasons that were animated by WIT studios were very good visually. While there was a lag between season one and two that had a lot of people fall off the Attack on Titan train, the improvement in animation quality over that time is pretty noticeable. The only thing I have negative to say about the WIT studio animation is two things. First, a lot of the aspects that come into play in the later seasons that had originally relied on WIT studios animating certain things that they otherwise didn't made for a confusing time for non-manga readers. While this wasn't completely their fault, it did feel like the ball was dropped about that in the earlier seasons. Second, their use of CGI in the anime felt a bit bulky. While for the time that it had come out it was something that wasn't really seen in popular anime, and it's understandable that with certain things animating it normally would have been a feat, it just felt unnatural to the world. Later on in the series MAPPA studios got their hands on Attack on Titan, and can I just say how incredible their animation was? I remember watching the first episodes they animated and loving the new designs for the characters. The characters looked more true to themselves in regards to the manga. The animation itself had such beautifully dark undertones to it that really highlighted the darkness of the story. And the CGI that was used by them felt much more smooth when it was incorporated into everything. No matter which studio was animating, the music was also something incredible for each season. Every single opening and closing song to this anime has to be some of my favorite songs, along with the soundtracks that play behind action packed scenes. The music always fits the mood and elevates scenes to their absolute full potential. Now that I’ve rambled long enough, I hope this helps you in wondering if you should watch Attack on Titan or not. No matter who asks me if I recommend it, I will always say yes. With a beautifully well thought out story that has an incredible message behind it, to the stunning animation, and playlist worthy music, I think it would be silly for anyone to NOT recommend a show like this!",Season_3_Part_2

It delved into a political story this time, which was interesting, and not in a bad way. Then from Episode 7, Attack on Titan was back to normal. The episodes started getting stronger, and there were some shocking scenes, gruesome scenes and also some beautiful scenes, and still with usual stunning animation. At the start of the second half of this season, it was clear this was going to be good. It got more and more dramatic, and the ... stakes got higher, and then it peaked with the episodes Hero and That Day, which were exceptional.

Fans had high hopes but low expectation so personally, I believe that it not only met expectation but also smashed it out of the park!",Season_3_Part_2
xida2t,7,"Mar 4, 2021",0/0,"Attack on Titan still makes the same mistakes it has been producing since 2013. Bad: —The characters keep explaining things after and as they happen — either in their head or in a flashback. -Not everything needs to be explained! This excess dialogue is slowing the plot down. -I have to admit; I want to know what characters are thinking before they die. However, Attack on Titan rarely does this. —Why did it seem like the Beast Titan knew about baseball when Attack on Titan takes place in 400 something C.E? ....... —Attack on Titan’s art style has always been weird. Still, the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan’s anatomy and ... CGI is starting to become bothersome. —The Colossal Titan kicked Eren into a wall when it could have kicked him straight to the Beast Titan. What kind of lousy writing is this? I thought the objective was to capture Eren. —I still do not like short piss-stained hair girl. She is only an important character because she has royal blood. Take away her royal blood, and what is she? Regular garbage. She is royal garbage, and I want to see her turn into regular garbage. Good: —I always liked the sounds of Reiner’s armored titan (the mechanical ones and his golem-like ancient voice). —I always wanted to see past events from the enemy’s perspective, and the show delivered in episode three. -Why can they not show flashbacks that people want to see and not waste the viewer’s time? R.I.P Marco —It has come to my realization that Mikasa is a dude. In fact, I like the idea of Mikasa being a dude more than a chick. She can be a girl at heart, though it would please me if everyone addressed her as a guy, and she used her deep voice all the time. —I am not going to spoil, but holy shit, this series is starting to get better! -I can not wait to talk about the plot in my season four review! —They “dealt” with a character I was not too fond of. —Oh my god, Misaka with bedhead hair is doing something to me 😩 —What they did with the Smiling Titan is ingenious. —“Anyone can become a god or a devil. All it takes is for people to believe it.” Jesus Christ, why is this series just now getting so good! —If they end up traveling through the past or to the future, freeze time, destroy time, you name it.... I am going to lose my shit! —I said it in my last review, and I will repeat it! Erwin is an underrated smart character! Now I know what he meant when he asked, “who is the real enemy?” —Floch is a great character. He’s like an attempt for the writers to be self-aware. I love it! Keep showing stuff like this, and I will put Attack on Titan in my top ten list. —This season is giving me “Truman Show” vibes. —Remember these two motifs, freedom and the truth. This series deals with both very well, and I will elaborate more in the final season review. Attack on Titan would be so much better if they combined seasons 1 and 2 into a 20 something season — cutting out a lot of unnecessary context. Also, combine some parts of season 4 with season 3 — cutting out a lot of excessive context in season 3’s parts. If they did that, Attack on Titan would have the best pacing of any Shonen anime I’ve ever seen! I might have to deprive it of a high spot in my top ten list because of poorly written characters and terrible pacing. :(",Season_3_Part_2
EMTMK,10,"Jul 3, 2021",0/0,"To me this is where AOT starts getting really good. Seasons 1 2 and 3 all start with a kidnapping plot. It was getting tiresome. Season 3 part 2 is really unique. It has incredible action, tough decisions, an incredible story, and great character arcs. It's the start of peak AOT. Sasageyo! Shinzo wo Sasageyo! Since this needs to be a longer review, I'll just write a small bit more about AOT in general. I binged it all recently. Imo season 2 was basically just a rehash of season 1, with a few differences. I was also disappointed when season 3 started with a kidnapping AGAIN. ... But season 3 part 2 is incredible.",Season_3_Part_2
fizzbitch,10,"Apr 18, 2022",0/0,"Is there anything to even say? The show that is already a masterpiece and a cultural phenomenon is even more polished is this entry. The return to the Shiganshina District, teased since the beginning of the show, is finally at hand. Tying together so much that has been built up throughout the series, this arc culminates the current story in a such a incredible fashion, that it feels as if it couldn't have been done in any other way. In typical AOT fashion, the ... odds seem insurmountable. The story delivers breath stopping tension and clever, and a believable narrative to address the challenges facing our heroes. What is great about this show, and this arc in particular, is that victory, if and when it comes... is not given. It is EARNED.  It gives meaning to the story progression and makes you that much more invested in the story. Season 3 part 2 marks the final chapter of AOT as we know it, and while excellent in it's own way, season 4 marks a noticeable shift in tone and story. This is ""classic"" AOT at it's finest.

AmericanSomnium,9,"Jul 10, 2019",0/0,"Absolutely stellar. The second part of Season 3 of Attack on Titan really brings in the heat. A whole host of plot development happens in a very short span. Characters die, plot points are revealed, and setup is given for what happens next (as shown in the manga). Interestingly enough I felt this was a pretty decent setup for the change in Eren's attitude from Season 1 to where he is currently in the manga today. Story: 10/10, they really just drop you in the deep end with the reveals this season. Without any spoilers, suddenly the story becomes less about existential threads as a species, and ... more as a race. Races are brought into the balance of power, as well as more insight onto how these titan powers have played into the history of the world. The show makes you feel for both oppressor and oppressed, as both sides unwillingness to let go of past grievances means they must participate in limitless battle. Art: I always thought the art has been a step down since Season 1 as I liked that bold lined comic style they always had. Animations for titan fights are still stellar though, and I'll not forget the last season with Levi and Kenny fighting in that bar. The animations make for some memorable moments, while the art services the story in a big fashion. Sound: The sound has never been a big part of Attack on Titan, and most are serviceable. Character: Eren really got what I needed out of him for this. You really see why later on he's gonna make some of the decisions he does. He was more in story as I'd argue he's the protagonist. However, great character development also appeared for characters like Armin and Erwin since Levi and Mikasa have already had their time in previous seasons. This really is starting to flesh out the circle of characters we'll be following going into the final acts. Enjoyment and Overall: I mean overall it's a real banger. I enjoyed every single episode whether I was watching a titan battle or pages of exposition laid out for me. There wasn't a single second I wasn't invested, and I think this is really worth your time whether you read the manga or you are watching the show.",Season_3_Part_2
kurotachimi,8,"Jun 29, 2019",0/0,"Ok first off, this part is good but it shouldn't be the second best rated anime. Spoilers boys The second part of season 3 remembers that the story without the titans is shit and it had not set up anything based on the politics in the walls well enough to carry a story, so they return to what is actually fun. lots of reveals in here as always, good voice acting all around as well as some decent twists that basically everyone knew because manga readers are a thing. However what the show demonstrates over and over again is its action, antagonists and music are just perfect. ... Eren is still just a tool for the plot but we can see him become reliable and Yuki Kaji does excellent work. Levi gets his moment of the series, Berthold isn't just some dude anymore and the pieces are coming together. The Marley backstory while not being as exhilarating as the earlier reveals works fine, it was hinted at and kind of shown way back in season 2 with Ymir and cruel world thing is running through them so it is consistent to the the themes. now the things that are bad. Mikasa has been sidelined since season 1, she has had nothing to do other than kill 3 MP and slice Armored Titan's legs, she is supposed to be an Ackerman, please let her do something. Armin's plan while effective was not like Armin at all, why is the second smartest dude using a brute strategy to kill the strongest titan, there were other ways to get him killed that stayed true to his character. He always used words and logic, planning and predicting before, but now he was just a distraction, also I thought he was all about I killed a human and that added absolutely nothing but I guess we can blame part 1 for that. Also, when they aren't fighting the animation is so stiff, the action looks so good and then next episode you have one piece type of stretching the show and the characters not moving. I feel like the first 2 seasons were much more dynamic. Finally, the edited versions of previous songs are just plain brilliant, the music is what makes this show better than good.",Season_3_Part_2
thestarsailor,10,"Mar 11, 2021",0/0,"I just don't even know anymore man. Everything has led up to this but I think this is the best season and my favorite season of the show. Every episode left me stunned with either thinking, how on Earth are they going to get out of this one, or just with my jaw on the floor at what just happened, particularly episodes 5 and 6. It's an absolute bloodbath and everything has changed and shifted to how the main cast now relates to the world around them. I knew of spoilers for certain things that were revealed this season in a vague sort of way, ... without knowing any specifics or the plot of the story, but now that it's all come together it just really clicked so well, like, say, a key in a lock. Yep, finally got to that basement and the history of everything was revealed, and adds a certain kind of distance from the main cast that made me empathize more with Eren and how he feels.

iSakuraSnow,10,"Jul 8, 2019",0/0,"I remember when the first season of Attack on Titan came out about a 5 years ago, and the hype was real. People tend to lose interests in shows, especially when their seasons slowly come out over the course of years. Attack on Titan may no longer produce the memes and parodies that made the show so popular that even those who did not watch anime at least knew about it, but its quality has not diminished, even at its slightest. It has just gotten better. Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2 is where everything makes sense. All the questions that were built up in ... the past few seasons finally tie back together to allow viewers to have a cohesive understanding of where titans came from. With lots of background on Eren's dad, dialogue, action, not a single scene was wasted. Trust me on the action part.

BabyGirl06301,9,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"Okay, hold up. Did I actually enjoy a part of AoT?? Listen, don't come for me, okay? AoT is good, it's just not my type of good. That being said, this last half of season three was bangin'. Let's start with the obvious praise that we have to give to the art of AoT. Though it's always been a bit bold and extremely detailed, I actually felt like the animation/art was better during this last ten episodes? I'm probably just imagining it, but the art felt cleaner in a way that made everything look nicer while still keeping the AoT aesthetic. Beyond that, I really enjoyed the ... story (for once) the entire way through. I don't know why, but AoT has always been sort of blah for me, so this part of the season grabbing my attention surprised me, and I think I've figured out why: it's the ending to a very long story and the beginning of a brand new one. The way that these episodes brought a lot of things together was very nice. Every episode, you're getting something important to the story that makes everything else you've seen come together. I personally was really happy to have that sort of conclusion to a lot of the open doors we've had thus far. That being said, the season somehow opened a whole bunch of new doors at the same time that gave me back the feeling of awe and anticipation that I had back at the beginning of AoT, when I first started it. I didn't feel like I was getting a lot of unnecessary information this last half of season three. It all very clearly pointed toward what's next. All in all, I usually feel like Attack of Titan is all over the place in my head when I watch it because so much is going on, but this part of the season essentially gathered everyone together in one place and made it a really good bit of anime to watch. I can't really say much because I haven't been this invested in AoT for a long time, but I think, in the future, I'm gonna have a lot more to say. I'm finally excited for Attack on Titan, and I'm pumped to see what comes next.",Season_3_Part_2
Iambae,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2, overall a great sequel to the set up season (Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 1) The way this seasons unfolds the plot, the character growth, the details the writers left throughout it, all amazing and very well deserving of its praise it. Though it took 8 years since 2011 to get to this point, it is all worth it. Throughout watching this you will find amazing character development, and a story full of revenge, depression, creepiness, mystery, ideology, a bunch of topics that are really well written and amazingly thought-out since the beginning of season 1. This season hits the hardest, ... when it makes make you try to connect the dots, somewhere along the story it will reveal something to you, but will it quickly cooks up another mystery so that feeling is not lost. The only thing that kinda holds me back is this artstyle, but maybe is just me... Sometimes the artstyle it looks great for creepy horror moments but for the most part I wished it had more care.

Demarcation,7,"Jun 8, 2019",0/0,"(Spoiler ahead) Shingeki no Kyojin 3 part 2 is a fair improvement from previous seasons but When I think about it 6 episodes in, there are still some issues particularly with the script and characters. One of the more iconic scenes in this season is that Levi has to choose to save one from Armin and Erwin, both fatally wounded in the battle. Although I do think the scene itself is handled brilliantly with adequate explanation and enough emotional and physical struggles to render a great impact, it's how the plot progresses to that point worries me. It's crystal clear that when drawing the manga, Isayama ... comes up with this ""choose one"" scenario first and then proceed to consider how to push the plot to that point, because he does so with incredible amount of plot conveniences and plot armour given to some characters. It's the exact reason why GOT season 8 is terrible and why the story is exciting but also cringe to watch. Heck, Armin somehow survives that burning and over 50 meters free fall, Erwin somehow survives the suicidal charge when he's clearly up in the front, not to mention there's another random soldier who somehow dodged all the rocks just to carry Erwin back. When you realise Isayama clearly comes up with the conflict first then based the plot upon that destination, it becomes incredibly cringe to watch. The amount of plot armour given to Levi and Reiner is also a bit too much. Now I can accept Levi has some crazy skills, but when I see him slaying 20 or so titans single-handedly and cuts the beast titan into pieces like a piece of meat, it's a bit too over the top. Despite all that, the pacing is great and the story is in this constant struggle-solution cycle that easily keep on the edge of the seat (I've read the manga years ago and still feel quite excited during the ride). Part 2 has some of the best animation in the series especially around episode 5 where levi slays the beast titan. Needless to say I do enjoy the first 6 episodes in general, but whenever I think twice about what I just finished, I can't help but to notice some of the aforesaid flaws. Other than that, it's technically 4th season now and the franchise's positive and negative aspects have been discussed numerous times, I don't feel the necessity to reiterate.",Season_3_Part_2
mxri,10,"Jul 18, 2019",0/0,"In order to write this review I must put aside my bias which is initiated by my 6 year relationship with this show. With that being said, having watched this show since the the moment of it's release I was filled with anticipation and impatience to see how it would eventually unravel. This anime managed to soar past all of expectations and depict the story in ways I'd never imagine. The story alone is outstanding and paced everything in an order that would give just the right amount of information while always leaving the audience eager to see what was to come. At the end ... of every episode of this season I grew more and more thankful for the ending teasers because I would not have been able to wait a week without any hint of what was to come. Each episode was thoroughly thought out and caught me by a pleasant surprise. I was moved by the wonderful development of many of the characters including Grisha. The backstory of the origin of titans was beautifully laid out and the wonderful art style during the ocean scene goes without saying. I feel the ocean scene was my favorite throughout the entire season. For the audience this scene was well anticipated especially surrounding Eren, Armin, and Mikasa. To say the very least it was a complex scene that required many layers of understanding. The audience was granted warm heartedness by the smiles on Armin and Mikasas faces, as for them the ocean symbolized freedom and hope for what was to come. While for Eren, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. He had an understanding of what the outside world was like though his fathers memories that paid him a visit through his dreams. Eren had to carry the burden of knowledge while knowing freedom was farther than they thought. This was a perfect ending to a perfect season of an incredible show.",Season_3_Part_2

Dennis_King,6,"Jul 20, 2021",0/0,"This review is a product of the perfect combination of mental illness, alcoholism and a head full of nothing but hatred towards humanity...Just kidding..My head is full of ouzo(if you don't know what that is...Well...Too bad). Now..Shall we get on with Attack on Titan 3? I suppose if you're here then that must mean that you've already watched everything before this , unless you're lost or something. If not just go back and watch the damn thing already. This season was, much like the 2 before it.....Quite different in everything..Season 1 was a great intro to this circle of hell when the wall of Maria fell and ... got introduced to these beau....No they weren't lookers now were they?In fact most titans looked fucking ridiculous..And that was a very big reason for me to not take this series as seriously as i should. I mean if your main attraction isn't threatening looking at all..It kinda spoils the fun, you know? And then season 2 dropped and...I guess the deeper you go the worse it is?......Let's say it was a very different beast than it's 1st counterpart and in all honesty..Much worse in many ways. For one, it felt like a different anime altogether but with the same cast more or less. It's not like it picked right from where the 1st one ended. As for the rest there is already my review on the 2nd one here so go read it you filthy maggots. What, too, was worse...The animation..And this new season is a mixed bag of Part 1 having impressive animation and Part 2 being the bastard love child that got abandoned at the church's footsteps with a note in its' flipper hands..The CG scenes are here as well and as harmful to your eyes as dropping a whole bottle of sulfuric acid directly into them. I don't know what possesed them to make the titans CG as well but god damn, talk about idiotic decisions. A not at all idiotic decision was to shift some focus from the titans to the people themselves and the conflict between humans. To me this was a good thing for 2 reasons..I don't like Eren and the constant reveals of titans...It wears thin after a while when every single person turns out to be one..Back to the conflict, it was that of the lower class and the ruling class(scouts and military police)..Honestly this was way more interesting and action packed than any titan fight i've seen thus far.. The presentation of the first half was far from the offerings of Season 2. The animation, the settings...Man it was great. Don't worry there are fights between titans and massive ones at that and boy did they drag the hell outta them. And the worst BY FUCKING FAR.......The damn Beast titan playing baseball with boulders..Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Just why? I wonder if in future installments they'll have him spit at old ladies and robbing kids from their lunch money.. As for the second half...Well either the budget wasn't big enough or i guess another studio did the work cause they were bored or had other projects going on at the same time? Don't know and don't care..The fact of the matter is that the drop in quality is as vast as the centre of the earth. Another big problem, which i mentioned earlier was the fact that in this season, much like the previous one, there is a feeling of disconnect from the previous ones. In season 2 there were little to no connections between them..And this is made worse when you go from Pt1 to Pt2..It's like the events of Pt1 didn't even matter. There is no sense of an overarching story as such. If you go back from this season to the 1st? It's like those events were from a galaxy far far away..Again why? Did you have anything better to do than connecting the damn dots together? As for the characters...Eren is still an irritating twat when he shows on screen and Mikasa still is..There...In fact i'd say that apart from Erwin and Armin who were the stars of the show, the side characters played a much larger role this time round and i think it was for the best. Now at this point it may look like i shit on this anime way too much but the thing is i still love it and i believe deep in my heart that this is a modern classic..Despite all its' faults i like it for what it is..Sure it has a wooden leg and a glass eye but it has inner beauty..And big perky tits! I'm also hopeful that the last season will somehow fix these problems and amaze us in ways we cannot possibly expect..But here's the thing...I'm not sure this is a likelihood and here's why...In this season they revealed everything there was about the titans and their history..Now the mystery is all but gone and i'm not sure what will be the endgame here..I have this sneaking suspicion that this was the peak Attack on Titan and from now on we are to be made witness to the bottleneck version of things..Still hopeful but...",Season_3_Part_2
DongkeyFong,8,"Jan 28, 2021",0/0,"EXPANDED HERE: https://jeromewei.medium.com/attack-on-titan-sucks-2e639e488c73 Shingeki no Kyojin is a deceptive little piece of work. At its best, it's a mystery show where the characters slowly piece together the secrets of their world, as past events that didn't make any sense at the time start to fall into place. At its worst, it's a show with boring characters, dull militaristic action, and predictable drama. Of course: the real meat of the show is the allegorical world backstory that's finally recovered in this season. Attack on Titan appears on the surface to be allegorical and alluding to historical situations, immediately bringing attention to the centuries-long persecution of the Jewish ... people. Though, that particular comparison is fraught, since the Eldian people seem to have been imbued with some of the most vile of antisemitic tropes---such as having strange transforming abilities and ultimately being a people who once controlled the world and desire to again. My takeaway is then that the sweeping allegorical plot of Attack on Titan is a Rorschach test, up to interpretation, and that interpretation can reveal much about the subject. It can be literally about the Jewish people, it can be about mainland China's subjugation of Hong Kong, it can be about white guilt and Robin DeAngelo's 2018 treatise White Fragility. It can be about Japan's imperial ambitions. There really is no wrong answer, but there isn't a correct one either. Attack on Titan is the ultimate apolitical piece of politically charged media---it takes no stance of its own. The conflict between the Eldians and Marleyians is portrayed as ambiguous. Clearly the Marleyians have become the antagonist and oppressor in the current power dynamic, but the past was clearly less black-and-white (although the extent of that is not clear; how much is Marleyian propaganda is not made certain). Look, right now the Eldians are the good guys and clearly have a right to fuck up the Marleyians, but it's possible that they weren't the good guys back in the day. Attack on Titan is really about history itself as an institution and the power of history to create narratives that persist over time. History can be rewritten, as we see with how the CCP justifies its subjugation of the Uighur population, how America justifies the War on Terror. History can be wielded as a weapon, to terrorize an entire group of people and have all citizens on board for it.",Season_3_Part_2

The way that the story played out was particularly emotional, and the plot twists really elevated the story to new heights. This series has taken a lot of twists and turns to get to this point, and the way that it played out has not disappointed by any means. With a show like this to have such incredible setups that aren't disappointing is ... astounding. The attention to detail is on another level. The way that each and every event leading up to this point and beyond is so important just shows how outstanding the writing is. The thought put into each and every event, and the way that this portion of the season references the prior events leading up to this point is brilliant. The story manages to become even more tragic as time goes on. The sacrifices in this portion of the season are particularly brutal, and the moral dilemmas that are presented don't hold back. This show isn't afraid to present these moral questions in a merciless and unceasing manner. The lore continues to expand and the amount of levels to the story has made this a superb and memorable experience.

oozePOP,10,"Dec 19, 2023",0/0,"This anime is seriously so good. Attack on Titan doesn't know how to stop being crazy. Attack on Titan is so full of action, mystery, and suspense, and it's delivered in such an easy to digest manner. The twists are always so surprising, even if you somehow manage to correctly guess what's to come. AoT is just a perfect anime, and season 3 is no different. The second half of season 3 is just as good as the first. It's got all the ingredients that make AoT amazing, but this half gives us a bit more exposition. We've been kept in the dark about a ... lot of things as we follow the Scouts and their traumatic journey, but in the second half of season 3, we start getting some really important answers. Usually, exposition episodes that only serve to explain context are really unappealing to me, but AoT has built up to that point so immensely that it feels like the few exposition episodes that arise are long overdue. They don't feel like filler episodes at all, and you're grateful as a viewer to have more context on this very complex set of circumstances. AoT is just awesome. Shingeki no Kyojin is the perfect anime for people who want a bloody anime that will bring them to tears. It's an iconic anime. Some of us grew up with DBZ, One Piece, etc. The next generation had AoT.",Season_3_Part_2

FEN1X64,10,"Jul 5, 2021",0/0,"This is the peak of animation. Without a doubt, people will be talking about this season for years to come. This is Attack on Titan at it's greatest. The culmination of years of foreshadowing, action, and character development comes to a glorious crescendo in this masterpiece of a season. The series could've gone out here and it would've been a bittersweet but great ending. It feels like Isayama gave it his all here and what we have left is good but I don't think will match this season. Spoilers Ahead Let me start with the breathtaking animation. It's what you've come to expect from Attack on ... Titan, fluid and fast paced. The Beast Titan and Levi fight is animated so well, Arifumi Imai was the backbone of the series animation wise. The only problem was the Colossal Titan looked bad and thats pretty much it. The soundtrack is also what you've come to expect, Sawano kills it with his score and it gives each scene that extra punch to hit hard at home. I love this track and to this day, I can't say anything hits harder than the collective soundtrack of Season 3 and S3 Part 2. Now the great stuff. The story is all about taking back Shinganshina and finding Eren's basement. Well, Bertolt and Reiner have something to say about it with their good pals Zeke and Pieck. The arc has a very basic story premise but goes so far, take the city at any cost. This arc sees each of it's characters put to their absolute limits here. Erwin has to make a conscious decision to sacrifice himself and nearly all of his men to buy Levi time to attack the Beast Titan. Eren has to learn that he has to lose people close to him to gain victories. Armin makes the ultimate sacrifice to take down Bertolt. Reiner and Bertolt grapple with the fact they must kill their former comrades. Levi continues to suffer his survivors guilt as everyone around him dies. This season put its characters through hell. Then there's the huge basement reveal. The mysteries of this world unravel as Eren is overcome with rage at the mistreatment of his people. He becomes the genocidal prick who put the Eldians in this situation in the first place. This reveal blew my mind the first time I watched it. It still does. Attack on Titan kept throwing you for a loop until it decided it was going to easy on you and dropped on of the biggest plot twists in history. It's so well written, it puts all of the asspulls that follow it and lesser stories to shame. People will talk about this for years to come. Going in blind was the best decision I've made. I love this season specifically for everything it did. Isayama pulled out all of the stops here and wasn't afraid to brutally murder many of his own characters to get you to feel something. Hero is one of the greatest episodes of any show ever. This episode is ethereal in that it exists. Nothing quite matches its beauty, brutality, and raw humanity. I am not watching a show, this is art. This is why animation is so powerful, limitless creativity. This season left me a changed person, I questioned things. Everything felt so natural, so real. Many live action works will never quite achieve the realism of our characters and their actions and their feelings and their struggles, it is quite ironic. The most unrealistic of mediums portrays it's characters so well, your suspension of disbelief is no longer required. I got so much out of this masterpiece of a season. As a whole, Attack on Titan sits at a 9.2 This season is perfect in so many ways, I can only give it a 10/10. 100/100. 9 dead titan shifters out of 9. In my humble opinion, this is as good as television gets.",Season_3_Part_2
adiroy2,9,"Aug 8, 2020",0/0,"Another great instalment by wit studios!. Nothing much to say exept that this will remain one of the most anticipated series for me. Great actions scenes in this part, especially levi vs the ape titan. Subarashii plots, and a freakin great game changing twist awaits in this season, for those who haven't watched. The ending and memoir of girisha has opened up vast possibilities i cant wait to see. The mutual discord between eren ,levi and Mikasa, which was shown post credits in the last episode of season 3 part one, has been beautifully unravelled. The animation is great as always, with innovative action scenes and a ... new gear in this season.  As for sound, i wish the wit studios restarts using german lines in the songs. It seems a bit cooler i guess XD",Season_3_Part_2
Hudsonwt,9,"Aug 5, 2020",0/0,"*Spoilers* This is pretty much The Village, just way better and more interesting. Part 2 of season 3 was so well done. It was able to top the opening of part 1 and there were so many great character moments throughout it. The scene where everyone swings into Shigashina in the first episode was so well done. The music and shot composition was off the charts. I completely lost it when Reiner popped out of the wall and Levi immediately impaled his neck, which is followed instantly by the appearance of the Beast Titan and all the other pure titans. The shot composition and overall quality ... of the sequence as Erwin leads the rest of the scouts on a suicide mission was amazing. I loved that we were able to dive into his psyche in this season as well. It made Levi's justification for saving Armin more solid, beyond the effort that the creator's probably had to keep the audience from rioting if he actually died. I honestly would've been fine with Armin going out in this season. The way he went out was displayed really well and his character would've reached a satisfying conclusion. I would've also been really impressed if the creators decided to take that risk and kill him off. That said, Erwin's death was still a huge blow. The fact that all the other scouts died is an additional sobering fact. Also, I found it really funny that after Armin becomes a titan, he becomes super buff as a human. The only real problem I had with part 2 was the exposition at the end. It wasn't the delivery, I thought it was well paced, rather the content. In the end I came to appreciate it, but the only problem I had was that the reason that the walls were attacked was ultimately to reach the resources that lay under the land, which I felt was very weak. To me it was a very boring reason. Other than that, I loved that the audience was finally able to understand what was going on. It recontextualized a lot of what had happened before and helped us understand why certain things happened the way they did. Finally got our beach episode as well. That ending scene was rough though. It really put into perspective how absolutely bleak the future looks for everyone and especially Eren. He finally reached the place he had been working toward all his life, only to find another wall and another war waiting for him. Can't wait for season 4. My only worry is that since MAPPA is producing this instead of WIT, the quality may not meet the same standard as the past three seasons. I don't have anything against MAPPA, it's just with a studio change you never know what you'll get. We'll just have to wait and see.",Season_3_Part_2
NearVengeance,10,"Sep 2, 2021",0/0,Now this is a damn masterpiece let me explain. For the people who love fight scenes in anime or in general will love this and for the people who have lots of questions get answered. The art is damn amazing except for the colossal titan but I honestly don't mind it that much. The sound are just perfect everything is damn perfect. The characters are superb a lot of the characters I did not care about in the past seasons made me still not care about them but some of the characters I love was just going higher and higher I have high expectations for ... this anime going out on my journey.,Season_3_Part_2
Landyra,10,"Jun 18, 2022",0/0,"re-posting my list-comment as review, originally written May 9th 2021: As said in my comments to season 3 part 1; I'm compelled to give both parts of season 3 a 9 individually, because for me they only become a 10 when judged as an entity. Most of my points for this season where already mentioned in my writeups for earlier seasons / part 1 of this season, but as for the episodes of s3 pt2 in particular: The reason I'd deduct a point when looking at ONLY at the second part of the third season is (extremely minor spoiler?) that the day started at ep 1 ... of part 2 lasts until episode 7, which only leaves us with 3 1/2 episodes to go. Now, is this a BAD thing? Not necessarily - a BUNCH of things happen and this runtime is filled to the brim with action, info and PLOT. It's needed! But this is the reason I want to look at the season as a whole, because just looking at the second part feels a bit odd, given that 7 episodes out of the 10 feels basically like one very long episode, which makes sense for the full season as a whole, but makes JUST the second part feel a bit disjoined as a standalone. That being said; I feel like the studio reached it's peak animation-wise in some scenes, and you can really see how they developed when comparing it to their work on the same characters (titans) in earlier seasons. I'm glad I always skipped the opening, bcs it basically spoils the entire ark, and it's (for me) the second least memorable opening song following the one from part 1 of season 3. Not judging openings here though, that's just a sidenote. The reason this still get's a 10 is that this has AMAZING plot-payoff. (minor spoiler if you care for expectation-levels) The third season in general makes the anime SO WORTHWHILE and rewarding to watch. The last few episodes in particular just exceed any expectations you might've had when going into this, unless you'd been spoiled previously or your brain works very different from mine. I don't know WHAT I expected, but I'm very surprised the revelation of the big questions that we asked from the very beginning managed to be both VERY DIFFERENT from what I expected but not disappoint me in the slightest. In hindsight, I wish I had mapped out what I expected the answer to be, because this is so absolutely not what I expected, yet it makes absolute sense. Again, I only give a 10 to season 3 as a combined entity, but I can't bear giving it a 9 for how I was glued to my seat for an entire day binging all 22 episodes when I should've been studying. This season is the reward that has been building up since episode one, and it's amazing! It opens interest in further developments, but at the same time it feels like a very satisfying ""ending"" - which kinda leaves it up to the viewer if they wanna figure this out altogether once and for all and follow through to the end, or if they're content with the answers we got for our original questions and want to leave it at that.",Season_3_Part_2
Hellothere31,10,"Nov 4, 2021",0/0,"This is the season that truly made me fall in love with AOT, and it literally has everything you could ask for in an anime.

This truly is the turning point of Attack On Titan, and you would never guess how Season 1 could lead to this. Art 9.3/10: Again just the CGI for the colossal titan, everything is amazing.

Characters 9.3/10:  Although not as ... good as last season, it has many satisfying ends to many character arcs, and more clarification on how Reiner, Annie, and Bertholt acted the way they did.  Eren's dad also went through an amazing arc in the flashback in the basement.  Armin really found himself this season and I felt like he was the highlight of the season.

coolrek123,10,"Feb 28, 2023",0/0,"""Attack on Titan"" is often hailed as one of the best anime series of all time, and for good reason. From its unique storyline and well-developed characters to its stunning animation and gripping action sequences, ""Attack on Titan"" is a series that stands out as a masterpiece of the medium. One of the things that makes ""Attack on Titan"" so unique is its premise. The world of the series is one where humanity lives in constant fear of Titans, giant humanoid creatures that devour humans seemingly without reason. The show explores the psychological and emotional impact that this fear has on the characters, creating a sense ... of tension and suspense that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish. At the center of the story is the main character, Eren Yeager. Eren is a complex and nuanced character whose motivations are driven by a desire to protect his friends and family, as well as a burning desire for revenge against the Titans who have caused so much suffering. His journey throughout the series is one of growth and self-discovery, as he learns to grapple with his own limitations and face the harsh realities of the world around him. But Eren is far from the only compelling character in the series. The supporting cast is equally well-developed and interesting, each with their own unique motivations and personalities. Characters like Mikasa Ackerman, Armin Arlert, and Levi Ackerman all add depth and complexity to the world of ""Attack on Titan,"" making it feel like a living, breathing world with real people living in it. Of course, the animation and art style of ""Attack on Titan"" are also major reasons why the series is so highly regarded. The action sequences are beautifully animated and choreographed, with each fight feeling like a visceral and intense experience. The art style is gritty and realistic, adding to the overall sense of realism and immersion that the series is known for. But perhaps the most impressive thing about ""Attack on Titan"" is the way it tackles complex themes and ideas. The series explores ideas of freedom, sacrifice, and the human condition, using its fantastical world and characters to explore ideas that are deeply rooted in our own lives. It's this depth and complexity that sets ""Attack on Titan"" apart from other anime series and makes it a standout work of art. In conclusion, ""Attack on Titan"" is a series that deserves all the praise and accolades it has received. From its unique premise and well-developed characters to its stunning animation and gripping action sequences, the series is a masterpiece of the medium. It's a work of art that explores complex themes and ideas in a way that is both accessible and thought-provoking, making it a must-watch for anyone interested in anime or storytelling in general. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or just discovering it for the first time, ""Attack on Titan"" is an experience that will stay with you long after the final episode has aired.",Season_3_Part_2
Bankai_Chigo,8,"May 15, 2023",0/0,"Well Attack on Titan season 3 overall was really mind blowing in some ways and I still feel like I didnt fully understood some scenes. So after I finish watching this anime, there is big chance for me to rewatch it in a near future once again cause its story and characters are to complex for one time watch. Story was during whole season engaging and interesting and it keeped my eyes glued to screen while characters had some badass but also some sad moments. Animation was very pretty and some visual aspects of fights were really amazing to look at . So , I feel ike if you ... liked previous seasons ,you will love this one even more and it will build you up for the final one.",Season_3_Part_2
PrincessKikyo23,10,"Nov 21, 2023",0/0,"This season was absolutely incredible! I don't even have words to describe how good this show is, especially in this season. All the development and all the buildup come together, and it is absolutely insane. The animation is great, the music is great but most of all the plot and would building is honestly some of the best stuff i have ever seen in a anime. Isayama is a absolute genius! Going into the show I just assumed it would be about a boy fighting monsters, BOY WAS I WRONG. It is show much deeper than that, watching season 1 to season 3, the audience ... has no idea for the wild ride they are in for. The basement scene was all worth the wait. The show will never be the same for me now. Also what I think is insane is the amount of foreshadowing. Like the second ending of season 2 basically spoils the whole entire reveal but without the context behind the creepy images one would have no idea what it all means, but this just goes to show how talented Isayama is and how much planning he truly put into the story. I have seen other animes do insane stuff but Shingeki no Kyogin does it the best imo. This hands down is the best season of this show. Everything good about the show is elevated by like 100 in this season.",Season_3_Part_2
Bensonas,10,"Apr 11, 2020",0/0,"My blown mind has just been blown even further.....I don’t actually think I’ll get it back! I’m going to start at the end. This conclusion is satisfying, even considering how much we have lost by this point. For those of you, the lucky ones, who will be watching this for the first time after season 4 has concluded, I can guarantee you will be watching season 4 immediately. It leaves you screaming for the next season. The continuation of the story is exceptionally well told. It is as wonderfully paced as Attack on Titan has ever been. It takes you on a journey through devastating loss ... to euphoric joy, from darkest space to the brightest place. There are no more words i could possibly write to truly express how amazing this story is other than phenomenal. Although part 1 will hold, and I am pretty damn certain of this, the most perfectly written and animated action sequence of all time, this season had one of the most emotionally engaging. For those of you that have watch Gon vs Pitou, it’s almost the same level as that and it comes towards the climax of the season. I really can’t say anymore without going spoiler crazy. In my personal opinion, if I was to look at this season alone, Attack on Titan would be the greatest anime ever written, it’s that good. Flawless story telling, exceptional animation and emotionally engaging. It really is a perfect season. The realisation of everything that you’ve seen comes together as one perfect picture at the very last scene of this season and shows how good conclusions can be. A truly exceptional piece of work and again, in my opinion, one of the best seasons, of not the best season of anime I have ever seen. Absolutely perfect in every way.",Season_3_Part_2

Plot: Original and in this season takes a very large twist and a lot of questions are answered at last XD. A cliffhanger at the end of every episode leaves you guessing whats gonna happen next. Characters: Simply great apart from a couple ... of them you really form a bond with a lot of them.

Some characters that were introduced this season were a bit forgettable and felt unnecessary but they weren't too bad. Overall I'd recommend watching this season.

izzymrose_,10,"Jul 30, 2021",0/0,"I'm not willing to make a review for each season of Shingeki no Kyojin so this review will count as one big review for the whole show. Theres a summary at the bottom if you're like me and dont wanna read all this shit (Spoilers) General Review: I first started watching AOT in 2018 as my first anime ever, and I dropped it in the 1st season because I had a problem with commitments, but I still loved it. I still have memories of how cool it seemed and how new everything was, and that influences my score for sure, but it still deserves its perfect ... score, even if AOT isn't perfect. Like any show it has its rough points - lame soundtrack that isnt even in Japanese, boring dialogue and slow pacing in S1, and some wonky CGI, but all of that is made up for by the incredible story and concept. The worldbuilding is extremely well done. Story: The story is amazing. I didn't get spoiled for the entire show so I pretty much got the ideal AOT experience, and I didn't see any of the twists coming because I'm a fucking dumbass. I love everything about the story. Art: Its pretty good. I don't like the thick black lines that outline pretty much everything and I'm not a big fan of how hazy everything looks in S4, but I can still appreciate it. The lines are pretty much pointless but you can interpret the haziness of S4 as a feeling of uncertainty about the world that has just been revealed to the Eldians I guess. Sound: The OST rocks and Sasageyo is amazing. Except for one or 2 cringey songs in s1 and 2 the OST slaps. Character: It's ok. The reason its not a 9 or 10 is because Eren confuses the hell out of me. I sitll dont get his reasons for doing everything at all, and I've read the manga. But all the other characters are pretty cool. Enjoyement: So much fun to see Levi chop up titans and shit Overall: 10/10 show IMO, if I'm being objective its probably more like a 9 or 8 but because I had the optimal experience and didn't get spoiled at all and watched the first season when I was young and dumber, it gets a 10.",Season_3_Part_2
Mack_Yeager,10,"May 11, 2022",0/0,"Attack on Titan Season 3 part 2 is arguably the best Attack on Titan season that has ever been produced till date ,the consistency in this season is incredible ,it is really hard to come back strong and please almost 95% of the fans when season 2 or season 3 could only please a few percentage of them. Here is a short review on why i feel AOT S3P2 is an absolute modern classic(without spoilers) Story(10/10):No matter how many times i rewatch this arc ,the part that stands out to me is the immense consistency and hyped this arc generates ,not only in the action/suspence department ... but the shocking reveals and calm before the storm ending, there is no random bullshit, random out of character moments, random explosions(like most other shounen animes), it all feels like it is planned and well directed, Isayama sensei worked immensely well on this arc ,from a tense buildup to epic important moments to a slap on the face plot reveals( that pays off in a stunning way that even after 3 years i still remember it) to a well balanced ending to the arc. The vibe and atmosphere this arc create is just fantastic and pleasing to the eye and mind. The execution is a bit off at times, but it does not take away from the high moment. Art/Animation(9/10):The art and feels is really really good but the animation can be off at times and dragged out .Art(10/10), Animation(7/10). For those complaining about the colossal titan CGI , i absolutely disagree with their opinion, Infact, it actually works well for the atmosphere it creates, if you see the hand-drawn colossal titans in season 4 part 2 they may look nicely animated but the overall atmosphere feels dull as compared to one colossal CGI titan in season 3 part 2 ,the actual problem is the inconsistent animation of the titans and sometimes the background does not match the foreground. while the art in this arc is absolutely other worldly take for example the last 3 episodes, that ancient type of feel it gives to the story with the yellow-brownish filter and well detailed surrounding and art work really blends well with the atmosphere Sound(9/10):Easily the worst part of season 3 part 2, aside from the endiing and opening sequence the ost's aren't that well thought out ,at some places it does work really well while in other places it creates a bit of annoyance while trying to concentrate on the show, i do like that in few of the episodes they decided to not incorporate any music and it worked really well for the situation, that approach was a genius move Character(10/10):The only AOT arc that has every character on the edge of their character limit, everyone had some or the other role to play with a wakeup call of anyone dying , the stakes were really high even for the background characters, it truly felt like a battle of wits, and showcased how everyone were so messed up in their heads that as a viewer you feel for the bad guys and the good guys , not knowing what will be unfolded before our very eyes, there are some characters that  you will want them to survive while there are some you wish they better die a miserable death. The scouts were at their absolute best performance . Then there are characters that were never introduced before who impacted the plot in very surprising ways that connect to the events of previously build-up seasons while at the same time setting-up for a fantastic Final season ride. Some characters developed more than expected . while some faced massive emotional damage overall the characters in this arc got equal development and screen-time. Enjoyment(10/10):Tense, heartbreaking, memorable, betrayals, emotional, anger, sorrow, hopefulness, wholesomeness, craziness, badass and calmness. Overall: In my opinion the Best AOT season and the third Best arc of the story overall",Season_3_Part_2
FlexySpagoot,9,"Sep 14, 2021",0/0,"The latter half of Shingeki no Kyojin Season three was quite a ride, with the first part being entirely focused on epic, bloody battles, and the second part being filled with one of the biggest reveals in anime: what's in the basement? The first half kept me on the edge of my seat with its high-stakes action scenes, while the second kept me interested with the reveal, and all of its implications and extensions. The fights of this part of the series were quite good, with the highest stakes seen in the series, as well as the most dire circumstances. The action itself was well animated ... and interesting to look at, although I think the fights had some slightly infuriating conclusions, although I don't see it really as a negative. Good fights are an important part of any season of Shingeki no Kyojin, and this one certainly delivers. The story was pretty amazing for this cour of the series, probably the best so far. The dramatic moments during the climactic fights of the first half are potent and strong, with plenty of drama and emotion to spare. The second half features the massive reveal, which I do think feels a little bit on the ""completely out of left field"" side of reveals due to the scale of the reveal and how involved it is, but I think that it was appropriately set up, with many things that occurred throughout previous parts of the series all lining up nicely. Since it's setup was done quite well I feel that it's scale only enhanced it, rather than making it seem outrageous and stupid as it likely would have happened if it was done with less proper set-up. The art is as good as it always is for Shingeki no Kyojin, with the exception of some dodgy CGI. Other than that it was as good visually as always. The music was also great, with a really great OP that I'll likely remember clearly for a good while. Overall I think this is likely one of, if not the strongest pieces of Shingeki no Kyojin. It has the action of titanic proportions we all love, as well as completing the task of answering the biggest mysteries of the series. It contained everything I could want from Shingeki no Kyojin and more, and makes me excited to start the final stretch of the series.",Season_3_Part_2

I think in many ways it is very overhyped but it is hard to deny that this season in particular is just a superb peice of entertainment, of any kind. The animation is beyond epic; the music - which I'd always thought was excellent - is as good as ever but seems elevated by the higher stakes of the story; the characters have always been somewhat lacking in Attack on Titan but due to some solid development in season 2 and the first half of season 3 they are better here than they ever have ... been before.

jamaycanmecrazy,10,"Apr 3, 2021",0/0,"This season we really got to see Eren Jaeger develop as a character, and he experienced arguably the most traumatic events in this season alone, which is saying a lot based on previous seasons. However, rather than talking about his character, it is the writing behind his character, the directing, the animation, and the sounds that all brought it together into such a masterpiece. The writing, by Isayama of course, is masterful just like every other manga chapter that he has made. This goes for every character within the series, but specifically Eren, Reiner, and Levi stand out as some of the most complex and ... well written characters. Their backstories, hardships, and character development really bring them together. For Eren, this season you really watch his character break, watch him become someone completely different than the basic Shonen character that he was in Season 1 and 2. As the the directing and animation, that was amazing. The fight scenes are so well made and bring all kinds of emotion make it very immersive. It brings the characters to life and finalizes the huge emotional attachment that starts to develop in Season 1 and 2. As for the sounds, the voice acting is PHENOMENAL. I mean, all of their voice actors take the cake for some of the most real and raw voice acting that I have seen (I watched in sub). Specifically Eren's titan roars and the sounds of the ODM gear, plus the music really bring it all together. This is probably my favorite season of Attack on Titan as of yet, even after watching season 4 (which was also amazing). Personally, I don't think that any other series will top Attack On Titan for me, but this season specifically was just, wow.",Season_3_Part_2
yo21,9,"Oct 9, 2021",0/0,"This is exactly what was needed after the slower paced part 1 of season 3. It focuses around one battle and you see some very emotional moments. A lot of characters really have a great moment for themselves like Erwin, Levi and Armin. One scene in particular involving all three of them was one of the most intense scenes I have ever scene. The titan fights were reallly good and in my opinion Levi really stole the show with his plan with Erwin. Once the battle is over however it does slow down a bit but it does not really matter cause we were rewarded ... with such a great fight.",Season_3_Part_2

Linkx7762,10,"Oct 28, 2021",0/0,"This anime is just simply amazing. There is no other anime that hooked me like Attack on Titan. The plot, the music, the fights, all just amazing and some of the best entertainment television has to offer. Here is my points on why AOT season 3 part 2 is one of the best shows ever made. Story. 10. While a little slow at first, this story really picks up the pace after season 2. This show always has you on the edge of your seat, and this season was no exception. It has some of the best action and dialogue i have ever seen. The moment ... the return to Shiganshina, the pace and action picks up and never slows down till the end. But the best part of the whole show in my opinion, is the basement reveal. This was probably the biggest plot twist in anime history, and was one of the best moments i have ever witnessed on TV Art. 10. Do I really to explain why Attack on Titan is a 10 for art? Sound: 10. Every opening in this show is absolutely exceptional and deserves all the praise it receives. And the battle music is also something to behold. I have never heard more upbeat and awesome music in any other show. Props to linked horizon for creating these masterpieces. Characters: 7. Overall, the characters are pretty boring, generic shounen tropes.( with the exeption of commander Erwin and Captain Levi) most are pretty boring Overall: 10. Excluding the characters, this show is perfect. Absolutely loved my time watching this and i cant wait for the final season. Basement reveal was some of the most entertaining and intriguing episodes of TV I have ever seen.",Season_3_Part_2

weabooslayer69er,9,"Jul 25, 2019",0/0,"Attack on titan was the anime of the year in 2013. The hype behind the show was immense and it seemed unlike anything I had ever seen at that point. Some of the elements that made the show stand out where the gruesome scenes, the frequent killing of characters from episode to episode, the booming soundtrack, incredible art/character design and the pure unadulterated moments of hype. Every episode just hooked me in, making me continually go from episode to episode. If I couldn’t watch another episode immediately, I spent the next day just looking forward to the next moment I could watch another episode. Once season ... one ended, the hype for more of the show was still strong. However, another season wouldn’t emerge until 4 years later. At this moment, my interest in the show had significantly waned as I got interested in other shows. I gave season 2 a shot and it wasn’t what I was expecting. For one, the main characters of Eren, Mikasa, Armin and show favorite Levi weren’t really focused on. Instead, new side characters that I had simply forgotten about such as Reiner, Christa, Bertholdt, and Ymir were being focused on from episode to episode. Also, the questions most of the fanbase wanted answers to (i.e. What was in the basement?) weren’t answered. Season 2 just felt different from the first season. Season one had the feeling of a horror thriller with tons of blood, gore, death, and fighting to go around. Season 2 felt extremely understated. It had more of a mystery feel with the 12 episodes being spent developing the lore and characters more. I will say I was a little disappointed by season 2. It wasn’t bad, but it was no season one by any stretch. Even during season one, I was a little disappointed that attack on titan wasn’t as unique as it seemed. Despite the death of many main characters, the viewer could be relatively certain that the main characters were safe. Also, the protagonist, eren Jaeger, acted as a standard shounen protagonist driven by the goal of eliminating evil. Also, the fact that he became a half human/titan just made it feel like another shounen. Characters didn’t feel very developed and the lore seemed to indicate it was going in a predictable direction. I decided to give season 3 a shot once I saw how the scores for the season were actually fairly high. I was glad I did when I first started getting into the new season. For one, the 3rd season acts as a sort of combination between the first two seasons. It has the hype, death, and gore of the first season with the mystery of the 2nd. The first half of season 3 practically turn most of the elements of the show on its head as new, unexpected enemies are revealed and characters work to discover what’s behind a giant conspiracy. This new development pushes the show in a new direction, as other characters start getting new development with explored backstories and harsh moral dilemmas. One of these characters happens to be Levi, someone who we see do amazing things in the show a lot without knowing how he came to be the way that he was. One strength of attack on titan is subverting the viewers expectations, one minute everything seems fine and then all hell breaks loose. This is not only present in the new season, but it is in a new form. For one, there are many moments where characters have to make choices that could honestly go either way. These choices have massive implications to the story and the moments before and after these choices are made hold the viewer’s attention all the way through the episode and beyond. In addition, the fleshing out of the anime’s lore makes the show infinitely more interesting than before and encourages them to keep watching to find out more. While I might have written off attack on titan as predictable and lacking any factors special to it before, I have changed my opinion on it now. Sometimes, the show will showcase characters that act like villains and seem completely underdeveloped. This often times isn’t the case since attack on titan is one of those anime that seems to hold its cards close to its chest. This means it continually gives you small pieces of information that keep you invested while withholding the rest. The writers of the show do this masterfully. So, while some characters seem underdeveloped, it is really the case that their development is just withheld for later on. I had initially lost interest in where Attack on Titan was going, but this new season drew me back in. All the elements people love about attack on titan are already here with new elements added in. Season 3 acts as a sort of cathartic release where the viewer’s patience is finally rewarded with at least some answers to our many questions. Credit must be given to the author of the manga who seems to continually evolves his story and shifts focus from character to character. Honestly, the layers of this show are numerous. It is a show that gets better with age. I keep watching to see how the world evolves and how the characters still manage to survive. When attack on titan got really big, it almost seemed like it was in a position to take the spot of one of the shounen big three. Now, it seems like it has earned that spot both by being massively entertaining and going against the current grain of anime. If you have made it to the current season, you already know you like the show. At this point in time, I am just on the journey to see where the story and characters go next. Attack on titan certainly did get better, I just happened to sleep on it. Don’t make my mistake!",Season_3_Part_2
Dante012,8,"Jun 13, 2019",0/0,"Okay, this season is not over yet, but I know the next episodes will disappoint me (I read the manga) so I'd rather write my review now xD. I'm not a fan of SnK. Never have been, never will be. However, it does do a lot of things right. This season 3 part 2... is no exception. It was full of awesome moments, the visuals and sounds are great, and the story covered in this part is probably the most important point since season 1 and they didn't screw it up. However, it also does contain everything bad about SnK. STORY In this part, the crew has to fight ... Reiner and Bertholdt (along with the Beast Titan and their army of normal Titans) in order to retrieve and repair the broken wall. If they succeed, they'll have the opportunity to finally get into Eren's basement and discover the ultimate truth. I love that pitch. Although it pretty much sums up this dozen of episodes, so in terms of content, it doesn't tell much. However, the lack of story points is really not important given how well they handled the few lines I wrote above. - The battle is full of strategy. - The episodes aren't stretched, there are no useless dialogues (like in the first part of season 3, for example). - Each episode has its brillant moments that will make you say ""wow, now THAT was clever!"" This is all good and all, but you can't expect me not to put in evidence the one main flaw, which has been present since season 1: the terrible narrating. Let me explain: - Many things are explained several times. It happens a lot in the battle. There's that one time when Armin tells a plan, then we switch to Reiner and we hear him discover the plan. As a result, the viewer hears the same thing twice in a row! Dude! I'm not stupid! You don't need to tell me something that simple twice! - The author clearly doesn't know how to handle flashbacks. At one point in the middle of the battle, there's a flashback about Marco. Who's been dead since season 1. No point in showing him again, especially when that flashback actually doesn't show anything relevant to the battle or the characters. Now I'm nitpicking here. Despite these flaws, the season was very enjoyable. Sadly, this battle is where the story stops for me. I hate what it becomes next. So I'll have to drop the show, but I'm glad I end up with such a memorable season. ART This is where things start to get messy. Yes, SnK has great visuals overall. - Great environments. - Some great animated scenes. - Detailed and dynamic fights. But it also has the same flaws as the previous seasons, namely: the chara-design. - It feels too flat most of the time. - The edges of the characters are WAY TOO THICK and COMPLETELY IRREGULAR. Edges are important because this is what makes the characters blend in the environment. Instead, it often feels like the characters are paste [i]on[/i] the environment. It's simply wrong. - The shadows are often hashes, which looks awful and non-realistic. Realism wouldn't be important in many other show, but this one tends to have a realistic feel, so... it's definitely wrong to get hashes. Also, the animators definitely want to get rid of those, as they are pretty rare compared to the previous seasons. It's like they put hashes as an ""early stage shadow"" and they just didn't have time to remove them before the release. Also, the CGI used for the Colossal Titan is... pretty bad. I wasn't bothered by that, but be warned if you don't like the use of CGI in anime xD. SOUND The OST is still epic as hell. The seiyuus are great, especially Yuki Kaji, as usual. But I didn't like the opening at all. Musically speaking, it was bad. There's a part that's not even sung... And the only good parts are the ones they copy-pasted out of the very first opening. CHARACTERS I've never been fond of the characters in SnK. Most of them are flat and barely have any story. When they do have a story, they become completely transparent once said story is introduced. I'll take Sasha and Connie as examples. They had one moment each in the previous season, now they're just... like ghosts. They're here just because they're here. The same for Christa, who didn't even appear in this whole part. Of course not, her story is over! Really, this is a big issue as this concerns each and everyone of them. ENJOYMENT This season 3 part 2 has everything wrong with this anime (misuse of flashbacks, ugly chara-design, overall flat characters), but that didn't prevent me from enjoying the hell out of it! The battle was epic, probably the best I saw in this series. It was clever, it had a lot of memorable moments, and that's all I expected. I loved it! And I know I'll hate season 4, so I won't bother watching it. But I'm happy with what I saw. In my opinion, SnK is definitely not the best anime ever. But it was definitely great.",Season_3_Part_2
pseudokyodai,9,"Nov 25, 2019",0/0,"F's REVIEW: Everything that has happened so far was to get here, and everything that will happen from here is just consequence of that. Right on the first episodes of Shingeki no Kyojin's first season, we are given only one assurance out of this cosmos full os mysteries and doubts: there's a cellar, and in it there's an answer. And I confess I wasn't so sure about it. I knew that this season would kick off with physical combats, which brings me bad memories from season 1 and its countless melodramatic flashbacks and graphic violence. I knew it would diverge from the last season's tone, which took ... its time on a construction of a carefully faceted mythology so wide for this fantastic universe. Yeah, I still think the rich of the series is in all those details that built this diegesis. The battles, as well as any threat that puts the characters in a life-or-death situation, have a history of being traps for its own narrative that, abusing the climax of these moments, take a chance to beg for some of the public's tears. And as the previous season inferred, it's not necessary this much effort when the situation makes use of the thoughts and relationships of and between the characters. With maturity and temperance in the approach, it just takes storytelling what must be storytold. Less is more. That's why the last episodes of this season simply change everything that has happened so far. With minor spoilers ahead... when we get to the episode of the ""choice"", when we're taken to a cul-de-sac where one of the characters must die, the maturity the anime reaches in this moment is enough to redefine the show's whole tone. So far, all those battles full of violence and stunning maneuvers (that benefitted a lot from the incredible animation design, to say the least) provided us moments of attention and tension and, when effective, emotion. The care the anime has taken in the relations and little gestures between the characters and even on the minimal objects scattered through the frame, from the 5th episode onwards, makes any of those physical conflicts as a low priority. It's this what the whole show's about. Not about vengeance, villains and heroes or any Manichean concept so ubiquitous in shônen animes. It's not about combats. It's about those details that drive us directly into that world's atmosphere - and what a world and what an atmosphere. Even Eren Jaegar, a character I had criticized an awful lot in previous reviews, came out better than started off in this season (at least in the sense of growth and multidimensional development). Even though I still get bothered with the absolute unnecessary choice of those flashbacks we already know of and are used to, at least here we get a better use of these mnemonic elements when we get access to an unknown genesis -- something that's been happening to help the character's building since season 2. In the perfect world this quality should've been kept in the whole 10 episodes, but I can't help thinking that the first ones, when the action's still the ""conducting wire"" of the screenplay, there's still a hard time in keeping the conflict as organic and mature as the ""moments-in-between"", generally resorting to some genre clichés, including those Manichean concepts I believe are abolished in the season's second half: the ReinerxBertholtxSurveyCorps arc deserved better. Anyway, the satisfaction in seeing an anime make way for such an ambiguous ending, and I say that as a compliment, is more than enough for me to expect the best conclusions for its next events. With an universe so well architected, both in time as in space (and signs of what might seem to trascend them both), I can't but root for the anime to honor its characters the same way they honored in this last stage, setting them up so well in addition to what surrounds them. Therefore, it won't be necessary no tears thirsty flashback: the consequences here are more shocking than the action, and reflect about them alongside our protagonists it's an experience that few audiovisual products got the chance to offer to its public like Shingeki no Kyojin potentially can make it in its final season. After all, who's the enemy? ~~~~~~~~ P's REVIEW: Succintly sayin', the part 2 of Shingeki no Kyojin's 3rd season is wonderful. I mean... it's the best season so far, keeping the quality just as expected. There are TONS of mysteries that were solved but, most importantly, TONS of new mysteries for us to think about incessantly 'til season 4. Even the protagonist turns out more interesting - takin' into account that I always thought he was annoying as hell throughout the previous seasons. Being the aesthetics impeccable as always, full of exciting action scenes well detailed, stories well developed for the characters and dramaturgical consistency, this gets to be one of my favorite anime seasons. I can say, for sure, this is a MASTERPIECE. thank you, bye ~~~~~~~~ F's RATING: 75/100 P's RATING: 95/100 MEAN SCORE: 85/100",Season_3_Part_2
jose_samson1004,10,"Dec 15, 2020",0/0,Probably the best season yet. Waiting for them to animate season 4 correctly which is a banger. This season showed the plot of the story and took some time but everything was well explained and all the details of the show are there. I love how the episode That Day specifically. Turning point of the show for me. There are episodes too that made you feel emotional and you just got to sympathize with the characters. They were able to present the story well going in with what will happen in the future events. Isayama probably loved shows like GOT and Breaking Bad that's why ... he kept on using foreshadowing and parallelism on this Anime. All in all a great Anime and hoping to get a higher rating in the coming years once the series is over.,Season_3_Part_2
SignorOrso,10,"Feb 13, 2020",0/0,"If you have watched the seasons before and thought it couldn't get any better, you were gravely  mistaken. My review: To begin, the story picks up where it left off, and it finally shows us EVERYTHING. Why they live behind the walls, the history of the titans, Erens purpose, who the real enemy is, and much more... The art is amazing as always. The fight scenes are fluid and beautiful so are the effects, and everything else. I don't know how they do it but in my opinion this opening is even better than the 3rd one. Its like they combined all the previous ones and what ... came out was simply amazing. The soundtrack is great too. The characters do get some development, there is drama and tragedy(like always). Still loved it though. If you enjoyed the previous seasons this one will leave you speechless. In my opinion this part is a masterpiece, everything has been done masterfully. It truly is magnificent.",Season_3_Part_2
Lofen,9,"Jan 10, 2021",0/0,"This is the season where this anime finally got really good. No, actually great. Many of the things in the earlier seasons lacked explanations and some characters lacked proper motivations for their actions. What happens in many series is that questionable things, like mentioned earlier, are often neglected, forgotten or explained in outright unreasonable ways. Exactly this made me sceptical towards this series. But alas, basically all of my concerns have been answered, and well at that. I can no longer question the greatness of this series. This raises an interesting point. Should this season retrospectively increase the score of the previous seasons? The other seasons ... basically had to be the way they are, I think, for this season to actually be as great as it was. So I believe it’s right to still view the previous seasons as worse, although this season makes the series great as a whole. If I had more faith that the series would actually manage to tie everything together in the end I might not have rated the previous seasons as bad as I did. I do believe that the previous season could actually be better by hinting more at what was to come. It almost came out of nowhere, almost. I realise now that what I’m about to say is somewhat of a spoiler, but you have been warned. This reminds of The Promised Neverland, although it only takes 1 episode for them to realise what's happening, instead of 3 seasons like in this anime. Although something that bothers me is how blatantly obvious the main characters plot armour is. If you have seen the show you should understand exactly what I mean. So yeah. This show, in my mind, went from somewhat interesting and cool but messy with many loose ends to something that makes perfect sense. Although all is fine now, I still somewhat dislike the previous seasons for not giving more clues. Oh well, nothing is perfect I guess, but this comes really close.",Season_3_Part_2
Im_Stuff,8,"Jul 17, 2022",0/0,"In this season of Attack on... what are we even attacking at that point? Erwin only committed warcrimes for science and the betterment of humanity, Isayama made the Jews from that Austrian guy's best seller into a real thing, Levi throws for content, Armin gets bullied EVEN MORE and Eren has discovered the end goal of gamers all around the world: genocide. This season can be most accurately cut into two parts, or arcs as people with ego problems call them. The first one is about siege warfare, monkeys, child abuse and Erwin's last warcrimes, and the second part is exposition dump, and the least arousing beach ... episode of all times. The siege warfare part is pretty much the thing you'd expect from AoT action, basically blood, death, and naked people. That and a few plot devices that may or may not be exploited further along into the story. And the exposition dump is about putting even more plot on your plot, explaining things I'm probably the only person to care about, more things that I'm probably the only one to not care about. Also Eren is now his own father, so that means he did have sex with someone's mother. As a package content, it was pretty good. I don't see what everyone raves about, to me it looks more like padding for the sake of elongation than it does Isayama's brain being the size of an 8 year old, but AoT's internal politics had me nerding enough to give its future external pokitics a chance. So y'know, time to watch season 4 I guess.",Season_3_Part_2
OfficialBandit,8,"Oct 12, 2021",0/0,"<Potential Spoilers> The episodes that the series has been building up to since episode one. Season three, part two has some moments that the series has been building up to since 2012. To be specific, whatever was in the basement is finally revealed. And to say it was something I didn’t expect would be an understatement. Aside from the basement reveal. Part two has a narrative that concludes the story of titans that we knew before and sets up the final season. The sound design is slightly improved from part one, the return of Wits best animation and some of the best character moments in Attack on ... Titan. In terms of the entire story of Attack on Titan, this small span of episodes is by far the most significant moment in the entire anime. It is the return to Shiganshina, the town destroyed in the first episode of Attack on Titan. The battle against the Colossal and Armoured Titan. We see the original cast work together and fight before we move onto a completely different narrative. While I won’t get into specifics, part two has some of the best moments in the entire series. In a way part two serves as a bridge between the story so far and the conclusion of the story. Part two not only sets up the concluding season, but sets up something that is far bigger then the world within the walls. The world is a lot bigger then we ever thought it would be. Part two answers every question that the series has set up. The sound design has slightly improved from part one of season three. While the voice performances were never bad in part one, or the sound effects. In fact, I’m willing to say the sound effects have always been good. The only problem being the fact that in combat we’ve only ever heard the satisfying sound of ODMG. Never anything else which risks the sound of the ODMG to get annoying. But with addition of thunder spears to the arsenal of our characters. The sound design of fight scenes have a little more variety. The main improvement from part one is the opening, I found red swan to be boring and is only good because of the opening visuals. This new opening is a lot more intense and highlights all the key moments  of the return of Shiganshina. However, the soundtrack hasn’t improved much. While many songs feel like they belong in Attack on Titan, they just don’t match to the soundtrack of season one or two. I can remember being emotionally invested in many key moments of season one and two, mainly because of the soundtrack. I can’t remember any moments like that in season three. It goes without saying that the animators of Wit studio are talented, you can see that talent shine within this part. The animation hits all the bases of good animation perfectly. Solid line work, smooth movement, characters blend into the environment seamlessly, the lighting and colours mix together, and so on. The animators hit all these criteria perfectly and have flawless demonstrations of the basics of good animation. However, the true talent of these animators really shows in the fight scenes. Whether it be the Levi vs beast Titan, the 104th training Corp fighting the colossal titan or the entire survey Corp fighting the armoured titan. All the fight scenes were amazing. Mikasa and Levi’s fast movements in the ODMG was both satisfying and brutal, highlighting how dangerous they truely are. The colossal titans transformation was one of the most shocking moments in the entire arc, and the way it’s animated does this justice. However, the cgi of the colossal titan didn’t work for me. And the anatomy of characters didn’t always remain consistent. At times, Erwins face would look squashed and not right. The series puts its focus on Levi, Erwin and Armin. Erwin represents a character that did everything to achieve his goal, going as far as to sacrifice hundreds of human lives to reach his goal. And even in the end Erwin never really achieves his goal and his efforts were for nothing. Character arcs not properly tied up make me feel true sympathy, because in the real world many people die without doing everything they want. And Erwin to me represents that idea. Levi is given one of the most difficult decisions in the entire series. We’ve always seen Levi act in ways that are either black or white. He does what he needs to do in order to push forward. A trait that isn’t really human. But the moment he has to make the most difficult decision, we see that he can’t just act based on instinct anymore. We can see a rare reveal of a very human character within Levi who feels true emotion. Armin throughout the entire series has demonstrated potential to be an even better commander then Erwin. Which is demonstrated in the training corps fight against the colossal titan. His true intelligence shines in the fight which is what saves the 104. And there are so many more amazing character moments in the series. The cast has many complex and deep personalities that are explored in the series. This second part serves to wrap up character arcs and transition characters to the final season. While this part isn’t without its flaws, season three part two of Attack on Titan is able to conclude the war against titans storyline and simultaneously sets up the final season. All while having good sound effects, the work of talented animators, and the best character moments. Overall, I rank this 8/10.",Season_3_Part_2

The main battle this half of a season revolves around is the best battle yet. The stakes are incredibly high and the two sides are very strongly motivated. I like the focus on Erwin, he is a cool character and it's good to see his grit tested in the ultimate battle. Eren, Mikasa and Armin of course carry their weight as well. Such a fantastic battle, excellent animation and storytelling. The Titan battles here are so damn badass, ... it cannot be understated. Because of the aforementioned stakes you are really invested to see them win. The big reveal is absolutely insane. It's a game changer and really really really good. There is cheeky foreshadowing before it, but there are hints throughout the entire show's run about it. So awesome how they reveal it. The brief glimpse of their reactions we get are impactful, particularly the closing scene's iconic image if you know what I mean. It's very good anime.

Nowkaayy,10,"Dec 5, 2023",0/0,"Attack on Titan Season Three, Part Two: This is where I finally felt like I was back in the first season—what an outstanding job Isayama, the animators, and the directors of this third season, second part, have delivered. The farewell to Wit Studio plays a beautiful role in this exceptional anime. Isayama demonstrates complete effectiveness in creating an intense battle, with plot intricacies, mysteries, fights, strategy, and emotions all on full display in his writing prowess. In this section, Isayama proves to be a genius, with every scene and episode showcasing the writer's complete mastery. Tension and movement go hand in hand in a single arc, ... which, in my opinion, is the best one so far. This is where I consider all the elements to be well-executed—all the decisions made by the protagonist, deuteragonist, and antagonists of this arc. Characters showcase their full writing ability, with antagonists exuding charm and delivering a stellar performance. Here, Isayama works at his full capacity, and I believe this segment represents the pinnacle of the entire work. Watching all the twists and turns, both in the battles and in the conclusion of this mystery, is perfect—the soundtrack and animation are impeccable. This is the point where everyone who has watched this far experiences suffering, screams, and cries with a range of emotions, which is not only good but phenomenal! Here's my 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2
Axasius,10,"Dec 1, 2023",0/0,"Attack On Titan, one of the most popular shows to date and has recently ended with a spectacular finale that has a led to a divide in the community. But, that spectacular ending would have been conceived if it weren't for season three of Attack on Titan. It was the perfect season in which all the buildup from previous seasons, the growth of main characters and side characters, the worldbuilding and shocking reveals that flipped the world the characters and viewer once understood upside down, and the overarching plot that showcases a reoccurring theme of hatred. This was truly the perfect season, and is the best ... season of anime to date.",Season_3_Part_2

Vermonia,10,"Apr 16, 2021",0/0,"It was a season that will give you great moments with both the story structure and the story process. When we compare it to the first 3 seasons of the anime, they paid more attention to the story. It was a season that guided the story by rotating the anime 360 ​​degrees. We see Eren's character development much more clearly. We learn great information about the history of the Titans. Question marks in our minds find answers. I strongly recommend you to watch it. Finally, I want to end with this words ""Hito wa izure shinu. Naraba jinsei ni wa imi ga nai no ka?"" Story-9   Art-8   Sound-9 ... Character-10   Enjoyment-10   Overall-10",Season_3_Part_2
Reered,10,"Sep 17, 2020",0/0,"I really like this season of AoT, to the point that I even increased the score of season 1 and season 3 after watching it. I think everything about this show that can be said has been said. Most loved it, some thought it was overrated. Some didnt like it. For me, it changed from a dude who liked the show to a fanboy. This season of AoT is great. It has intense action and drama. The tension is through the roof. There is actual emotions being evoked in every moment the battle takes place. Every time the battle dynamic shifts there is an actual sense ... of victory or dread. Add it with a great reveal and poof you have got a banger. With all that said, this season of AoT does not do anything new. If you are not interested in any of its aspects- the mystery, the characters, the reason why everything became this way, the story or the action, then you are going to think its overrated( a meaningless word imo). Only if you had ANY interest in any of the previous seasons, can this season convert you, as it takes all the great elements of the previous seasons, perfects it, puts it in a 10 episode package and boom, a banger. This is great.",Season_3_Part_2
ewilliams0090,10,"Jun 14, 2020",0/0,"Shingeki no Kyojin, Attack on Titan, whatever you want to call it, is a literal classic in the making. Like every other person on the face of the heart, AOT was my first anime, and I cannot shut up about it. I watched season one back when I was in 4th grade, and the day I was asked to write about my favorite T.V show and character, you know DAMN well I answered AOT and Mikasa. Now was it emotionally scaring to watch that one guy put a gun in his mouth and kill himself in that one episode in season one? Yes. Did I ... continue to watch the show? Yes. What can I say, my badass 10 yr old personality came directly from Mikasa herself. --- Now let's get onto the actual review. I'd like to start off by saying a lot of people think that AOT is overrated, and you know what, to an extent, it kinda is. Now what I mean by this is that seasons 1 and 2 can be considered ""overrated"" and I would partly agree, but the show was still goddamn amazing. The plot was original, the characters were loveable and different, the show could go from people being eaten alive to potato ( BEST! ) girl flawlessly, and the animation was gorgeous. Don't get me started on the soundtrack and ops cause you already know I loved every second of it. Now I understand how the hype died down for season 2, considering the 4 and a half year wait, but again Season 2 didn't fail to impress me again, with all the stunning characters, visuals, and plot development that we all fell in love with in Season 1. Now we finally arrive at Season 3 ( only took me forever to get here ) but this season, both parts 1 and 2, is what is going to make AOT one of the greatest animes of all time. In Season 3 each character has major development, and you can't argue otherwise. There's no longer just best girl Mikasa, badass Levi, horny-for-titans Hange, and ""MAYBE IF I SCREAM ENOUGH THE TITANS WILL FALL TO MY FEET AND I WILL CRUSH THEM WITH MY BARE HANDS I WILL EXTERMINATE THEM FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH!!"" Eren. They become so much more than just these characters playing a role, and they have some of the best character developments I have ever seen. Its no more angsty teen kills mindless titans, as is portrayed in Seasons 1 and 2, but these characters grew up, and we grew up with them. Their morals and beliefs may have changed over the course of the previous seasons, but they stay grounded in their roots, and to see this as a viewer is beyond amazing. The plot just gets better and better as you go, and all the reveals and additions make SENSE. They're not just throwing random things at you left and right, and with a little bit of brain-power, you can easily see that the plot is so much more than is just at the surface. We are introduced to racial discrimination, corrupt government and society blindly supporting it, different cultures and beliefs, and different characters and their response to this flood of new information. These characters realized their just living in a world that is just part of something bigger, and their whole lives and distances has so much more meaning than what they make of it. This isn't just ""let's go kill titans"" this is something that has evolved past just titans and humans, past humans and humans, this has involved into a show focused on human nature and how people choose to react in a society where nothing is as it seems, nothing is right or wrong, nothing is what they thought it was for decades. This is more than Attack on Titan, this is literally our lives right now. Now with all that said, Season 3 is so so SO deserving of the hype it got in Season 1, and I'm proud of everyone who stuck with the show because it really did pay off. If you dropped AOT after season 1 or 2, KEEP WATCHING. I know the female titan arc wasn't for everyone and trust me I know one signed up for ""grwm! forest riding!"", but please watch through it because there's so much value in those episodes you thought was annoying, and just because it doesn't make the most sense in the immediate moment doesn't mean that the entire show sucks. I will also like to say that a show not making sense in a moment doesn't make it a bad show at ALL. The animation throughout the entire series remains consistently beautifully, the characters remain amazing, and the plot is something we've never seen before, so if you don't like the show in it's earlier seasons, you never really watched the show. Let it evolve into the show we all love and you'll understand the hype. And finally, if season 4 is executed properly, Shingeki no Kyojin will easily become one of the best animes of all time. I know everyone's not up to date with manga ( which is going fucking WILD rn ) but please wait for season 4 to come out before you make any final decisions about the show. If you're looking for resolves, deeper character development, more fighting and everything else TRUST ME it's coming. In my perspective Season 3 pt 2 had all of those things and more and I absolutely loved every second of it, but if you have doubts about the series, just wait a bit for Season 4 and hopefully, you understand why this show is going to be one of the best shows made in history. Thanks for reading everyone! and goodnight!",Season_3_Part_2

Questions are finally being answered. Things are beginning to make sense and tie in with each other. The characters are the same characters we've been with this whole journey. It wasn't as mind-blowing as I remembered the first two seasons, but I enjoyed myself this time around. The pacing is nice, as every decision and thought is nicely detailed and rational.

IcarusxIcarus,8,"Jan 5, 2020",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan was tasked with adapting some of the most important material in the entire manga, material that will have large ramifications for the final season coming out next year. Despite having some problems and being inferior to the manga for the most part, this season of AOT did its job well enough, being a suitable supplement for the manga. I wasn’t very impressed by the first four episodes of this season. I’ve never been too fond of the titan fights in this series, so when they also look rather subpar, animation wise, I hardly get anything out of it, but ... thankfully episode five was absolutely spectacular. Arifumi Imai carried this episode with some genuinely incredible animation cuts. Levi vs the Beast Titan, while not being scored very well, looked fantastic. The dynamic camera angles and Imai’s understanding of high speed movement are as present in this fight as they ever have been. My next animation highlight was when Eren took down the Colossal Titan, animated once again, by Imai. The thing that I appreciated the most about this animation cut, was that at the start, as the camera quickly rises, the building in front was traditionally drawn, not a 3D model as is usually the case in Attack on Titan. It added a more elastic feeling to the animation which is something that I greatly appreciate. To discuss the visual direction in this season, it was quite frankly, subpar. Tetsuro Araki’s absence was once again felt in this season. The overwhelming intensity and overall visual flare that he brought to AOT in the first two seasons will probably never return. The great animation was able to cover up for the weak direction in episode five, but most of the other big moments in this season just felt rather flat. The scene between Grisha and the Owl on top of the wall was particularly disappointing. In my head I could picture exactly how Araki would have handled the scene, but what I was seeing on screen was a far cry from what I pictured. The actual narrative of this season was great from episode five onwards. Armin went back to being my favorite character after the events of episode five, and then episode six, while being mediocre adaptation wise, sold the emotion of Levi’s decision well. The basement reveal was a very interesting twist and served to massively expand the scope of AOT’s world. Changing the nature of the story so much this far into the story is a very bold move, but a very good one, as the setting of being trapped inside of the walls was starting to become rather played out and boring. Grisha is finally explored as a character, and overall, his backstory was quite interesting and was aided by the intrigue that I had for the new setting. But the highlight of his backstory was the previously mentioned scene on top of the wall with him and the Owl. Despite the poor direction of the scene, it was a truly shocking twist to the story and served as a rare example of how exposition should be presented to an audience effectively. Overall, this was the second best season of AOT, doing a great job of setting up a much grander story that will be present in the next season. I do hope that Araki comes back for the next  season though.",Season_3_Part_2
margunwan1,10,"Feb 20, 2025",0/0,"Erwin is the best anime character of all time. Eren's fine i guess. Mikasa is bland as always. Armin.... idk. But the battle of shiganshina is really good. Also the conclusion and the reveal of truth is shocking. I believe 2 out of 10 points that I give is because of the shock factor. Plot is good, but could remove parts that adds little & only acts as a backstory to a character. Historia is bland but damn do I like blonde. I think SnK is one of those anime that even if it's adapted (and it is) into any media, it'd do well because how ... well it's presented. Oh, and also the reveal are fire. Suddenly all of the things make sense. This is a really good show & season.",Season_3_Part_2
SageToad,8,"Nov 28, 2020",0/0,"This season really made it clear that this isn't just a supernatural anime, this is about war. I could feel the intensity in their desperation and fear as they faced their enemies, putting their lives on the line even when the felt they had no chance. Standing between them with seemingly nowhere to go, it was a no man's land. I was surprised by much of the information revealed regarding the origins of the titans, almost having you wishing for ignorance. There are certainly Nazi overtones, but the addition of the titan powers creates a strange dynamic where they are literal demons. I wish the show would have ... spent more time elaborating on the reason for the conflict between the two groups. It's still treating the real origins like rumored fables. Life and politics within the walls is as confusing and tense as ever. This season presented a lot of civil conflict and tough decisions. Congrats to the english voice actor of Grisha for their performance. I really liked their voice during their narrative parts. I am very much looking forward to another season.",Season_3_Part_2
Eoussama,8,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"“Shingeki no Kyojin”, the phenomenon-show that has reached enough popularity it's become dangerous to bash on. But toxicity aside. You have to admit that the show does a lot of good deeds it becomes hard to nitpick the minor flaws it has. But that doesn't make any less of an excuse for such a big budget production that has remained faithful to the fans throughout its serialization. - Story (8.5/10): This season, in particular, was the connecting point for a lot of past foreshadowing and clues that filled the entirety of the 3 seasons, a lot of plot-changing reveals and game-shifting events wrapped. The series has changed ... into a course we never expected when it first debuted, which magnificent and proper character development for the majority of the main cast. The pacing was not at its hight, I can arguably say that season 2 had was better paced, probably due to the hyper action sequences it had. Something I did not like was how Levi turned from an interesting character to being a lame plot device that's used whenever the show needs to justify or get away with something, but unfortunately, most people think that an overpowered character is an example of a well-written character. Which in Levi's case was relatively expanded on in the previous season, however, his power flexing spoils a lot of the plot. It could have been more creative to have a better way for the “goodies” to have an arsenal up their sleeves rather than a flexing boi in a green cape. - Art (8.5/10): I'm going to say that the series has had some better days, visually speaking. It felt that this cour had probably the worse production value on a greater scale compared to the other seasons, it seems like they started running out of money, but who am I kidding, this series sales like a God's church. The color palette remained as gloomy and medieval as ever (except for the last part of the final episode, but I think that was a great decision regarding the emotional impact of that moment, as depicting freedom as a brighter, much livelier colorful atmosphere). The anatomy was kind of off at times, out of shape faces and overgrown heads, you see, that's what the real problem the animation department had, consistency. I guess that this show really needs years-long breaks in order to retain the same high production value, but you know we are not going to be able to hold it for another 4 years, especially that the final season is probably in the making. - Sound (8.5/10): Leave it to “Shingeki no Kyojin” for the final flex, really, the voice acting cast know what they are doing the whole time, for a show filled with emotional hits all the time, you really need a capable talented group of people that can deliver the same feels that matches the emotion animated on their faces. And you know this season had a lot of those moments especially. The opening theme song this time around felt like a mix of all the other 4 openings, you don't know what one to use, just smash them together, and it worked. I'm not so sure about the ending theme song, not the best in the show, but also not that bad. The OTS is just another thing that you just have to hand it to “Shingeki no Kyojin”, taking down Titans takes a lot than slicing their back-necks off, it takes a strong, hype and blood-boiling soundtracks that make you imitate the boys as they go about their freedom-seeking duty. - Character (8/10): Watching the first episode of the franchise and some random episode from this season back to back would totally feel like an entirely different Anime, the biggest change would be how different everybody is. Eren went full 180deg on us, from a screaming angry “I'm going to slaughter all the titans” boy to a more mature and quite strategy enforcer that understands the bigger picture and realizes a greater goal than just ripping apart giants' neck. Ermin received quite the recognition that's totally deserved regarding everything he did for humanity as they know it, gained a lot of courage and experience and is no longer the shy oppressed slim boy he used to be. Basically, everybody else has had a noticeable development so far, and I would say that except for Mikasa if anything, she's still as dead in the eyes and as concerned the whole time as ever. Levi is just the same thing, I guess there must be something with this Ackerman clan. - Enjoyment (8/10): Not the best season of “Shingeki no Kyojin” in my opening, there was a lot of praise and hype that I totally bought, but it ended up extremely disappointing, especially for the “controversially-top-rated” episode that caused a lot of buzz-talk for a couple of weeks, I literally found that the episode after that was ways better, buy into hype was a lesson I had to learn sooner or later, but even so, it was not enough to ruin a great show. - Overall (8.3/10): If you've already watched 2 seasons and a split cour for this show, then there is really no excuse to not watch this second cour too, for how good of an investment you already made, grab a drink, watch some recaps, and just dive in, it really was a different kind of mix between the good ol' action-packed “Shingeki no Kyojin” and the massively political spirited part 1 of the 3rd season.",Season_3_Part_2

Razer_Gen-321,9,"Jan 11, 2021",0/0,"In my opinion, this is AOT's best season of AOT's entire season. but it does not rule out the Final Season will be the best. but for now, AOT season 3 part 2 is the best. In this season, the story presented is very interesting from the previous season. The outline of the story is that Eren and friends reclaim Wall Maria which was destroyed previously due to the attack of the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan. Their battle scenes against the Colossal Titans and Armored Titans, as well as the Beast Titans are epic. The tireless battle was shown to Eren and friends. But in ... this season, many characters die from titan attacks, especially the Beast Titan. Even Levi was almost dying. Many other tense moments, Armin dying and then getting Bertoldt's Colossal Titan power, almost dying Levi, Titan Eren VS Titan Reiner, the use of a lightning spear and others. And when they managed to reclaim Wall Maria, finally the secret of the dungeon in Eren's house was revealed. Some of the secrets about Titan began to be revealed. Animations and graphics are as good as before, but there are some improvements. I think Colossal Titan animation uses 3D cgi (I don't know).

The two characters I didn't care for in season 2 return, though they're fine here and get some decent development. The other characters likewise, and there are cathartic moments where comeuppance occurs (especially during a certain fantastic action scene). I really do like the juxtaposition of a pretty basic objective (getting to a basement) amidst a war. And the objective the main protagonists had since childhood, when achieved, is pretty melancholic and a good summary of the show's overall tone. I've no idea what happens next, since I haven't read the manga, but it's exciting with ... all the new developments in the story and its characters.

WazThatTL,10,"Mar 26, 2021",0/0,"AOT Season 3 Part 2 is what 99% fans have been expecting from AOT for a long time. The last couple of seasons were amazing dont get me wrong but hey a good start don't matter if you can't finish it. AOT has gone much beyond than what we were expecting, it has reached stellar expectations and it doesn't look like it's going to fall of it's reign. An absoloute banger to end a season like that! It's probably the best season in AOT in par with Season 4. For such a short season it manages to cover pretty much everything without feeling rushed. I'm ... thankful that it's back to it's original tone and atmosphere compared to season 3 part 1. Dark , action-packed and heartbreaking. Our questions and thoughts finally answered, the unknown being brought into the light, the world being a whole lot bigger than ever before. It had great pacing with emotional emphasis and with confident directing, Season 3 Part 2 of AOT outshines the rest in dramatic storytelling and flawless plotline. This seasons manages to give us a season 2 type vibe for the characters. We are reuinted with the original characters that were absent in part 1, Reiner and Bertholdt and introduced to new characters such as Floch and Zeke. The directors primarly focused on the original cast such as the trio, Levi, Hange, and Erwin. In terms of character development we see it from Historia who has gotten somewhat used to the role of queen. Eren, who seems to falling faster and faster down a firey rabbit hole with the amount of shockers and horrifying truths he is getting. And with minimum development from characters such as Connie, Sasha, and Jean. I expected for Mikasa to be a bit deeper. We know some things such as her undying love for Eren and seeming to be completly flawless. Tbh nearly 50 percent of her lines were saying ""Eren!"". Hopefully I can see more of her in Season 4. The visuals were amazing as usual and pretty consistent. It drops a tiny bit in episode 7 for the first few minutes but is nothing to worrying. The shading, the animation, the drawing of the ruined town of Shiganshina and the Beast Titan. I mean it's an anime in 2019 whaddya expect! The music is quiet similiar to season 3 part 2, but lacked in the use of choir and vocals. If they could bring back similiar tones of music from season 2 that would be great.

Maverick_71,10,"Nov 22, 2025",0/0,"Those who have watched SnK up until this season have been waiting exactly for this season and its contents. There is an absolute, peak thrill and suspense in every episode. This is because the Scout Regiment is on the precipice of discovering the secret that has been evading the audience (ie, us) from the very first season. On top of that, they have to do so while battling against unfavorable odds inside the enemy territory, which only seem to worsen as the battle progresses. At stake is the survival and future of humans within the walls, their identity, and finding who the enemy really is. ... The season itself is a very complex interplay between characters' emotions, the moral weight of their choices, their interpersonal relationships, sacrifices, bloodshed, battle tactics, foreshadowing, the uncertainties, hope and many other elements. Every other thing, such as the music, the animation, and the screenplay, is of such a high quality that it could become a gold standard. The season has given us two of the most iconic moments in the animeverse. The unique storytelling style has the audience on the edge of their seats. In the end, the season has completely changed the story, its characters, and the audience's perspective. After finishing the season, the people are still absorbing the experience. Even to write a review of such content is a daunting task due to the complexity of the artwork under review and the wide array of emotions it evokes across the spectrum, ranging from elation to hopeless despair. I may even be biased when I say this, but there will be very few instances in the future when a piece of fiction as good and popular as SnK Season 3 Part 2 will be created.",Season_3_Part_2
Scanerior,9,"Sep 21, 2025",0/0,"The second part of the third season is great and presents an exceptionally successful fight between humans and titans. Then we move on to the last 3 episodes to reveal the secrets of the titans... which I was really looking forward to, because throughout the series we get a lot of questions and almost no answers, however, I was rather disappointed and annoyed, because we find out that the ""modern era"" is mixed with some kind of old one, there are a lot of unnecessary religious motifs and in general it is actually just another stupid fight of humanity. Moreover, at this moment it reminded ... me of the series Lost, which I was not able to even finish watching, as I gradually started to get bored. I am glad that at the end of the season, at least our heroes achieve their dream goal and perhaps the last season will be able to use its potential and convince me that this story revealed at the end of the third season makes sense.

Ashahax,2,"Oct 16, 2021",0/0,"They say that this arc is a masterpiece, the best of simps no kyojin, at least I, I don't know in which head that can be said, it is a terrible arc like the whole work and now I will explain why: Superficial sections such as art or sound are fine, although I managed to notice one or another frame that would serve for a meme, and being superficial details I would not add many points for that. The only reasons why I see that they praise this arc is for Failed Zzzmith and Inutil Arlert, and at least for me two good characters do not save ... an entire work, in the other sections they fail, everything is so convenient, predictable and stupid, many Sometimes they repeat things that are already obvious, or that at the time of the syringe, those two are dying Zzzmith and Arlert but obviously as one is the protagonist and the other is secondary, it is quite obvious who they are going to save, and that they are still alive despite the fact that They are equal or more wounded than the other soldiers, but of course, we both need them alive to create a false drama. I won't bother talking about the others too much because they are terrible, like the sacrifice of a minor character like Moblit and Hange's reappearance being both predictable and convenient, Connie and the Titans making jokes in the middle of seriousness, Sasha being a burden, Jean doing nothing but saving Hange in an equally convenient way, Eren and Mikasa being unbearable and selfish, not respecting the decision that their friend made, Levi jumping to kill Reiner instead of capturing him, and being able to carry so many titans and To the titan monkey despite being bleeding too much, Floch despite the fact that his salvation is very convenient seemed to me better than the others, especially his speech in chapter 12, the antagonists were better worked, although they do not save this disaster either, and the pure titans well Zeke made them look foolish. In conclusion the characters at least the vast majority are terrible from beginning to end. The revelation that there is life behind the walls was a shit, so much suffering, sacrifices, corny monologues to reveal just something that everyone denied, and with Grisha's exposition, it is more of the same than anyone could deduce, but how Simps No Kyojin treats his audience as retarded is explained like this, and the story (at least up to this point) is well planned but the execution is a mess in its entirety. Conclusion: This arc is a disaster just like the entire work, terribly unbearable characters, plot and narration being a shit that treats viewers like idiots, horribly executed story, more blatant conveniences and inconsistencies than previous seasons, revelations that serve to make gets too long, and it has no end, everything was left on the air for later seasons that would be worse than this. 2/10",Season_3_Part_2
lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

The narrative is so deep that i can even describle, the coffee is the best foreshadowing that i see, and builds that world with maestry, nothing less expected of the master Hajime Isayama, the tension and the hype of ''pan pan pan'' soundtrack is such epic, i can't describle too. To finish i would like to put, shingeki is my favorite anime of all time because is just so realistic and mature to be considered ''shounen'' anime to ''young boys''.",Season_3_Part_2
Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography.

Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end.

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2
Raptor97,10,"Jun 9, 2019",0/0,"The Basement guys... My head was never that mindfucked... (Story) RTS Arc is just perfect, end of story. The music is as always OUTSTANDING. Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2
OzuThopia,10,"Jun 3, 2019",0/0,"Segura essa review goodtaste: Erwin starts the show being the best character ever made in anime industry, he is smart, strong, beautiful, and with devotion with devotion! The narrative is so deep that i can even describle, the coffee is the best foreshadowing that i see, and builds that world with maestry, nothing less expected of the master Hajime Isayama, the tension and the hype of ''pan pan pan'' soundtrack is such epic, i can't describle too. To finish i would like to put, shingeki is my favorite anime of all time because is just so realistic and mature to be considered ''shounen'' anime to ''young boys''.",Season_3_Part_2
Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2

However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography.

Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end.

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2
Raptor97,10,"Jun 9, 2019",0/0,"The Basement guys... My head was never that mindfucked... (Story) RTS Arc is just perfect, end of story. The music is as always OUTSTANDING. Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

The narrative is so deep that i can even describle, the coffee is the best foreshadowing that i see, and builds that world with maestry, nothing less expected of the master Hajime Isayama, the tension and the hype of ''pan pan pan'' soundtrack is such epic, i can't describle too. To finish i would like to put, shingeki is my favorite anime of all time because is just so realistic and mature to be considered ''shounen'' anime to ''young boys''.",Season_3_Part_2
Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2

Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2

However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography.

Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end.

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2

However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered.

YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end.

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased.

With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

The narrative is so deep that i can even describle, the coffee is the best foreshadowing that i see, and builds that world with maestry, nothing less expected of the master Hajime Isayama, the tension and the hype of ''pan pan pan'' soundtrack is such epic, i can't describle too.

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2

Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography.

Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there.

mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2

However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next.

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered.

YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end.

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

The narrative is so deep that i can even describle, the coffee is the best foreshadowing that i see, and builds that world with maestry, nothing less expected of the master Hajime Isayama, the tension and the hype of ''pan pan pan'' soundtrack is such epic, i can't describle too. To finish i would like to put, shingeki is my favorite anime of all time because is just so realistic and mature to be considered ''shounen'' anime to ''young boys''.",Season_3_Part_2
Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2

It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2
awesome5,10,"May 22, 2019",0/0,"Kino. Pure, undiluted, unsatured, unconfined kinomatographique. Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end. I for one welcome our new free overlord. Overall kino/kino Nothing else to say. It's the peak of the medium and nothing else in the history of story writing every came close to it.",Season_3_Part_2

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2

However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it.

This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"".

Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography.

Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2

Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.

lt_wassile,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"The unknown is always too easy labelled as a threat, and it is easy to join that particular chorus who claim it, mainly due to fear, fear of failure and concern of personal cost. On the basis of that postulate, the journey resumes for our SnK characters, as they prepare to undertake a fierce battle against those who want to annihilate humanity...however, is that these guys objective? It is well known the one-of a kind storytelling attributes this adaptation has: the understated foreshadowing –great for those who like to re-watch shows-, the captivating epicity, the more than famous plot twists; nevertheless, it never stops to amaze ... me the ability –and specially, in this season- they have had to build, step by step, a huge storyline that is both fascinating and enjoyable, while being able of connecting the dots that had been scattered during the 3 seasons prior to this one -all of this without making the story messy and confusing-. While I am on this subject, I have to bring to the table the marvellous combination of this storytelling with the animation and music. One of the most overlooked aspects, not only in anime, but also on the film industry, is the ability of a motion picture to use this or that piece of music, sound, silence and/or frame in this or that given moment to capture the audience and, what can I say, Shingeki no Kyojin does it extremely well on this season. Speaking about music, this asset is and has been one of SnK’s hallmarks. Not only the use of it –as I mentioned before- but the compositions per se are just one of a kind. Am I the only one who listens to them on a daily basis? And if this was not enough, WIT studio decided to bring into the equation some of the old soundtracks from season 1, which we will all agree were masterpieces. Furthermore, speaking about other technical aspects, the animation has made quite an improvement, leading to great results. This made some of the events –including fights- that took place over the course of this season something special: backgrounds were depicted in a really wonderful way, movements and facial expressions were really fluid and seemed pretty natural (including the Omni-directional mobility gear animation where camera rotations and 3D movements were executed to perfection) and pace was used fantastically well –that episode 54 fight it’s a great example, where Levi moves so fast that it takes time to the physics to actually catch up with him, making it look like he moves at the speed of light-. This, accompanied by an amazing sound design, a cast sounding as good as they do and a very good characterization, makes Shingeki no Kyojin a really wonderful series to watch. And don't forget what a banger the OP was. Moreover, I’m glad that, between the chaos of war, they have set aside some time to explore the inner conflicts of some of our characters, their convictions and motivations, the reason for them to fight, as well as exploring on how their decisions not only changed –and will change- their lives and made them who they are now, but the lives of the people around them. Characters like Levi, Armin or Erwin, who had not have so much screentime-development over the course of the show gain in importance on this season -it was about time-, without laying aside others like Eren -who finally shows a glimmer of manhood and logic-, Mikasa, or even our titanic traitors -if you know what I mean-, as they also meaningfully develop. For instance, side characters no longer feel like side characters. So, while I’m not in a position to say that I would never see something like this in awhile, I can say that this season was, hands down, a dazzling, breathtaking piece of animated work.",Season_3_Part_2
ShinyHex,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"*Review contains spoilers till episode 4!* We are blessed that we're living in a timeline when we are getting return to shiganshina animated. We have linked horizon back for the OP, we have been teased with the basement in this season and on top it, we have the banger soundtracks from season 1 back! While the previous part of the season was primarily focused on politics and mystery, this season has been primarily focused on action and hype. But trust me, this season has a lot more to it in the coming episodes! This season started off with 3000 levels of hype with Erwin's epic speech ... in the first episode. The mind battle between Erwin and Reiner, the subtle foreshadowing of coffee being non-existent inside the walls, Berthold's character development, Erwin's inner monologue and his cathartic moment have been the highlight of this season for me. Shingeki has been expert in subtle foreshadowing. Eren eating his dad, or shadis being his dad's former acquaintance or Marco's death; everything had been foreshadowed before. It was after the trost fight when Annie was constantly saying ""I'm sorry"" to the dead bodies as if being in regret that she couldn't save anybody, but it was in fact that she was responsible in Marco's death. Erwin's charge was my favorite moment of the manga and I'm impressed on how WiT managed to pull off this in such a manner that made me cry once again. Erwin has always been my favorite character of the series, the most charismatic character ever. In the time since SNK first started airing, Erwin went from being a desperately undervalued character to one of the most popular, and I couldn't be happier. His complexity, his unwavering resolve, his growing obsession, his strategic mind and adaptive nature, his decreasing ability to mask his emotions, his complex relationships with Levi and Hange, his largely unspoken mentor relationship with Armin, his physical capabilities, his fearlessness... There is a ton of intriguing depth in his character. And on a personal note, his struggles with disability and inability to slow down in spite of it really resonate with me. Shingeki no kyojin has been my favorite series. It has a unique way of storytelling.  Some people believe genius is hyper-complexity that makes uniqueness, which is why those people will shit on 'simple' foundation for works of art. But to be honest, those simple, bare and raw ideas that are so fascinating and fresh to capture the energy of so many people comprises true, fundamental genius. SnK's idea was as simple as it was unique, and still somehow familiar enough to satisfy our ease with the genre: man-eating giants -- not the ugly, inhuman-looking giants you usually see, but straight-up naked giant people -- three tall ass walls, and then people within those walls. Shifters didn't 'become' or transform into their titans, and the Titans weren't some sci-fi bullshit; the bodies were flesh and blood and literally formed around them like an extension of themselves. From there, Isayama managed to make a world so complex, using these fundamental ideas made me admire the series as it is as of now. Shingeki anime has been blessed by our god composer Sawano which doubles the quality of the show. This season has brought back so many soundtracks from season 1 which never failed to give me eargasms. The artstyle is better than the thick lines, and character designs are closer to the manga. The animation quality is mediocre, which was a slight disappointment. This season of shingeki has been my favorite season so far!",Season_3_Part_2
keragamming,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Clap clap* before I start this review I will like us all to bow our heads and have a moment of silence for all our fallen comrades, just like us they them-self started this series from season 1, but as time passes and more seasons are release many has fallen and so I will like to congratulate each one of you for making it this far and finally being able to see what is in that damn basement! lol Now let's begin this review. Imagine if you were a fish that since birth has been living inside a fish tank, you are unaware that there is a ... bigger world out there with vast oceans where you can swim to many different areas and see various different species. That is basically what Eren and company were in, and we as the viewers were also in the same situation. Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is the season that connects all the previous seasons neatly together, this was three seasons in the making. Snk is an action/mystery series that builds its foundation and then explodes with greatness when the apparent time comes. To appreciate this season you have to realise how important foundation is, in terms of setup, without proper build up this season would not be getting the praise it currently has, because if there wasn't any foundation the impact of the basement reveal and the character interaction/fights would be lacking, there would be a big void there. I think plenty of persons believe the basement would be the end game, where after finding out what is in the basement the series would eventually end, the twist is that the basement is simple the key to open the next level of the series, the first 3 seasons were simple the prologue and it is now time for the series to touch on the main plot or the true issue at hand. Visually this season looks great despite the issues with the animators, the staff did their best with this season from the awesome soundtrack, to the great action scenes, some fights were lacking a bit like episode 2 also the cgi Collosal titan was a bit distracting at times, but that still didn't affect my enjoyment of this season, the voice acting in this season was phenomenal especially in episode 6 when there was minimal ost used in that episode. The interaction and development for some of these characters in this season was also a highlight, especially between Erwin and Levi, there is a famous criticism that snk gets a lot and that is that the characters are bland, but I think it is an outdated criticism back in season 1 that needs to die, simple put a lot of characters didn't get much time to develop in the first seasons also in retrospect some of the characters didn't get early development because of their secrets, but as more seasons were release, the more the characters grow on you and the more you appreciate these characters and want them to finally be free. Despite giving this series a 10/10, don't take it as me saying it is a ""perfect"" series, because no series is perfect and this is where I will point out a flaw I personally have for this particular season and that is the fakeout in this season, specifically regarding Reiner and Armin, I didn't like the situation/explanation in how they both survive and that bothered me, but here is where Isayama shows why he is a God writer! he somehow finds a way to make something great come from those two sour situation for me, with Armin in episode 6 and how that was written was just incredible the same with Reiner, can't say much but all I will say is that he is putting him to good use, not often a writer can write something you as the viewer didn't like but then just blow you away with what he has done with that particular situation. I don’t think I will ever like it, but what I am getting at is that nothing in this world is perfect, just like how you care for your close family and friends and you know they have their flaws, you argue with them at times and there is somethings you don’t like about them, but in the end you care deeply for them, it is basically the same for loving a series or someone despite their flaws. And to end this I will say to all anime only watchers, I know that some of you are nervous, excited and even skeptical on where the series is going, but trust me when I say you should have faith in Isayama, he delivered on the basement reveal and has set up the series perfectly for the main course, see you all again in season 4 and make sure that you will not become another fallen soldier when the next season arrives, Erwin would not be pleased. Thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day.",Season_3_Part_2
DarthInvader,9,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"*Minimum Spoiler Review* TL;DR: From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this is the season fans have been waiting for since Season 1. We have been blue balled long enough. It's time to finally find out what's in that bloody basement. If you didn't watch any previous seasons, don't even bother reading or watching this anime. Go back to watching your crappy anime. We are in the endgame now. [Story: 9/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 10/10] ""Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless?"" - Erwin Smith The second part of Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan ... Season 3 picks up immediately where it ended. No delay in pacing, no unnecessary flashbacks, we are in the endgame now. If you've been following this show, you know where we are and what's at stake. We all want to know what's in that basement. So let's finally find out. Question is, are you ready? Can you handle the truth? If there is one thing I'll warn you, after learning the truth, this season will immediately surpass any of the previous seasons and just turn the entire show upside down. If you can't handle the truth, avoid this season. Your watch has ended. If you can, let the clash begin, for Isayama has the best curve ball prepared since GRRM wrote Game of Thrones. Don't worry though, thankfully we don't have incompetent writers like D&D to screw this gem of a manga up. With the animation powerhouse of Wit Studio and musical prowess of Linked Horizon, Tetsurou Araki delivers the justice this manga have always deserved. It's been a while since we've seen an anime that can equally deliver on both action and plot. ""It's us who gives meaning to our comrade's lives!"" - Erwin Smith From Titans being shredded to human bodies being melted, this was the bloodiest season of them all.  This season is the season of revelations. All the hype that's been building up since season 1 about the bloody basement is finally going to be explored. Question is, who will survive to know the truth and who will die trying. If there is anything the preview showed us last season, we know Araki will be jamming to ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" as he skillfully directs this cour. The story is linear but you're constantly at the edge because every episode ends on a cliff-hanger and the dead bodies just pile up. Despite how fast paced each episodes are, you know certain episodes are going to be jaw dropping when they start without playing the opening song. What's more, some episodes, there is more after the end song. Just downright crazy. Last season we tackled the moral dilemma of our living system within the walls by juxtaposing the childish and adult view whereas this season we tackle the racial political dilemma of genocide, murder and ostracism. The only complaint viewers are allowed to have is maybe two more episodes to flesh out the plot better. Overall, the manga is beautifully adapted and no qualms about it. ""My soldiers, rage! My solders, Scream! My soldiers, FIGHT! - Erwin Smith Time after time, the characters of this show just always stand out. Despite this season being more plot heavy, the characters still managed to steal the spotlight, especially Erwin. As each season are passing, more major characters are dying; that's why we are able to focus more on the key characters of the show and better understand the uphill battle they are always facing. This not only heightens the anxiety and tension but delivers a cathartic feeling in their success or death. Last season, our heroes had to go up against humans and deal with the ramification of murder. This season, despite reverting back to killing Titans, they have to deal with the ramification of murder again. It seems Isayama wants to solidify within us, no matter how much we enjoy seeing our heroes kill Titans, murder is murder. Moreover, none of this would be possible had it not been for the seiyuus. Every damn season, they are going above and beyond to give each character such depth and plot, hell even minor side characters are voiced so well. You just can't help feel right in the moment of the story. Huge kudos to them. ""No casualties, Don't you dare DIE!"" - Levi Ackerman Aside from the stellar linear plot & well developed characters, if there is one thing this studio does justice, it's their animation & art style. Without any surprise, this season they nailed it again. At this point, they have set the bar so high, good luck any other studio, attempting to reach it. Every panel was hand-drawn really well and the use of CGI for certain action sequences flowed really well. Kudos to the key animators. We know they bailed on us part way last year since they were not going to finish the animation in time but be glad they took the time. They delivered. The background score was really hype throughout all the fight sequences and the drops right before key enigmatic moments definitely escalates the excitement each episode. Linked Horizon is back again for an eargasmic opening song, even if it sounds very similar to their first opening song and the ED song is nice and chilling. When the OST is released, fans of this show will enjoy listening to it repeatedly. ""I always knew you were the bravest one out of any of us"" - Eren Jaeger Overall, SnK S3 P2 significantly blew all previous seasons out of the park. Is this season perfect? No. Is it the best we've seen so far? Yes. Isayama is a master of foreshadowing and this season from all the revelations, you will be going back and realizing just how many scenes and dialogues you overlooked thinking it would never be important to the story. Given how well Araki and staff of Wit Studio adapted the manga by rearranging the story arcs to showcase a better linear plot, it really accentuates the rewatch value of this show. Even after it ends after it's final season (which has also been announced), fans of this show can continue to rewatch over and over again. At this point, if you've come this far without spoiling yourself, then anime watchers, I would recommend hold your breath and not read the manga. If you're a manga reader, be happy your fav manga was adapted this well. Without spoiling too much, the series ends with a new purpose and goal for the characters. The real war is about to begin. Nevertheless, there is no point not watching this season of AoT. You've already invested in watching previous seasons, so might as well binge watch this season. That's always the best way to watch this anime. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao. P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",Season_3_Part_2
Krunchyman,3,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"[Spoiler Warning] Prior to season 3, little was known about the origins of the titans, as the previous seasons focused on humanity’s survival in the face of impending doom.  While bits and pieces were revealed through the Reiss family history, nothing about the titan’s origins were divulged.  Until now!  Yet, should we be pleased with these revelations, or disappointed with the paltry character development?  Because let’s face it: Attack on Titan’s (AOT’s) characters are terribly written. Starting with Eren Yeager, he’s gone from being a vengeful edge-lord who was consumed with killing titans at all costs, to a whiny, vengeful edge-lord ... who can’t think beyond his emotions.  Rage, sorrow, and regret is his entire range of feelings.  Besides his family lineage and transformation into a Titan, he serves no other purpose in the series. After 2.5 seasons, I still don’t know who Mikasa is besides a cold-hearted, reserved girl who obviously loves Eren (that smile in episode 10, tho).  She’s the female version of Levi, a proverbial bad-ass who is all style but no substance.  Levi is brutally honest to his comrades and honestly brutal to the Titans.  Like Mikasa, his combat skills are nonpareil to cover his overall vacuousness as a character.  Also, while AOT built itself up on semi-realistic fights, it became too enamored with making Levi look ‘cool.’  His fight with the beast titan stretched the limits of human physics to the point of comical absurdity. Erwin is the veritable “go get ‘em” leader with his hardened determination and unwillingness to surrender, despite the circumstances.  His laser focus on accomplishing his goals makes him very one-dimensional (CHARGE!).  I understand that he was constrained by the rock throwing of the beast titan, but a full-on kamikaze ‘attack’ seemed ill-advised (CHARGE!).  Correct me if I’m wrong, but why couldn’t they help capture the armored titan and colossal titan first, then wait for the beast titan inside Wall Maria?—setting up an ambush, if he decided to come.  If the horses were lost, who cares!  Eren could have turned into a titan and carried his comrades back to Wall Sheena or Wall Rose. As for Armin, he seemed somewhat relatable, given his initial trepidation and eventual growth as a self-confident strategist.  But overall, he came off as extremely plain and ill-explored.  Furthermore, due an in-universe plot device (i.e. the titan’s regenerative powers), his ‘sacrifice’ lost all emotional impact; speaking of which, it was humorous when Floch started calling everyone out at the award ceremony for being complicit in Erwin’s death.  Dude knew how to rain on everyone’s parade at exactly the worst possible moment.  But in all seriousness, it was a contrived rant that felt soap-opera-esque to drum up tension in a jejune final episode. As for the aforementioned revelations — a primary reason a preponderance of people are watching AOT — they were interesting, but not enough so to counteract the paltry characters.  You can only ‘horrify’ the viewer so many times before they become desensitized to it.  Moreover, the progressively foreboding tone made the story feel mechanical.  A good story needs to have some irrational flexibility, otherwise its contrivances felt forced and theatrical.  The introduction of titan lore was fascinating and made sense within the context of the story; however, the overuse of ‘shock and awe’ has made Attack on Titan rather predictable. While the animation exceeded most expectations, it should be noted that the colossal titan had some jankey aesthetics.  The OP was a rehash of ""Guren no Yumiya” — a creative block? — and the overall pacing was atrocious.  It seemed like whenever the Survey Corps were in a battle, there was a million flashbacks that drag out the proceedings.  But if the WWE can have lumbering, slow-witted ‘giants’ string along the audience needlessly for ratings, why can’t Attack on Titan?  Quality aside, it certainly brings in the cash!  Just understand what you are getting into.",Season_3_Part_2
HellLyter,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great. But this...this ... is extraordinary! WIT Studio clearly went all out with this season. It has practically everything that any rabid fanboy (and any casual watcher really) could possibly want: exhilarating action, captivating dialogue, mind blowing plot revelations, and more. This of course is clearly reflected by the overwhelmingly positive feedback that the show has been receiving. And for me, it's totally deserving of all of the praise. This season essentially tackles what is the ultimate battle between humanity and the titans. Every previous episode has been culminating towards this confrontation, and it's a spectacle that exceeded my highest expectations. Strategies employed by each side are ingenious, and it's bittersweet to witness the immense losses taken as a sacrifice to ensure victory. Instead of just having one character be the hero, I was pleased to see that it took the power, planning, and perseverance of practically all of the major players to pull off an epic win. Erwin's charisma, Armin's tactics, Levi's strength, and more were all vital when it came to taking on their foe. This just made the entire experience so rewarding by seeing all of the characters who we've spent years following contribute to what is potentially the most significant battle in all of Attack on Titan. This approach was much more effective then having some of them cast aside as worthless, and gave worth and meaning to every character. Speaking of worthless, there's something that I'd like to take the time to clear up. Years ago, when I wrote my review on the first season of Attack on Titan, I mocked Armin for being a weak coward and a generally useless character. I'd now like to officially retract that statement and admit to being wrong...and kinda douchy towards poor Armin. Though it's not just me. Even the other characters in the show always seemed to underestimate Armin's abilities and worth. While his closest friends and even Erwin eventually understand his potential and see his value, it wasn't until he stepped up his game in this penultimate battle that everyone finally got to see how this apparent coward might just be the most courageous of them all. The other stand out character for this arc who I'd like to give a special mention to is the other blonde boi and Sasageyo Super Star Erwin Smith. Throughout each and every season, Erwin has slowly climbed over the rest of the cast to eventually stand on top of all of them as the best character the show has to offer in my opinion. I've briefly mentioned his charisma already, but I can't stress enough how inspirational this guy is. Erwin even makes me want to get up and give my heart, and he's a frickin anime character! The weakest point of Attack on Titan for me has always been the characters. Yet with each passing season, they just keep getting better and better. I've already mentioned two of the characters, but the rest have been kinda growing on me over the years. Levi and Mikasa are absolute badasses. Eren has actually developed a bit beyond his ""I GOTTA KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!"" mentality and actually develops a semblance of a personality. I also really like what they did with Bertolt. He came out of his shell a lot and gained some confidence. Though he's still completely eaten out by Armin in that department. Whoops, totally meant to say beaten out, sorry about that. The glue that just brings everything together would be the show's audiovisuals. Attack on Titan completely eclipses the other Spring 2019 anime in terms of presentation with its pristine animation. It doesn't just look good, but the technical aspects that went into its creation are most impressive. A great example would be the Levi vs Beast Titan fight. I watched a detailed video discussing the mechanics that went into designing that scene alone, and it's ridiculously high in quality. It's insane to think about all of the care that the animators put into this series. The AOT animation team at WIT Studio is easily one of the best in the industry, and I commend their efforts. Voice actors do a phenomenal job at conveying expression. The performances in the emotional episode six alone were enough to solidify the seiyuu as exceptional in my book. They were always good, but the writing of this season gave then a chance to really shine. The GOAT Hiroyuki Sawano returns to compose the soundtrack, and it's, well, typical Sawano. In layman's terms, simply fantastic! I've spent a lot of time fanboying over the return to shiganshina arc, but I don't want to overshadow the back half of this season, which is great in its own right. We get to see the backstory of Grisha Yeager, Eren's father, and it has some excellent plot revelations and world building. It also hits right in the feels too. It basically ties everything together, which only serves to heighten the already unique and intriguing narrative. This show features a plethora of great moments. Whether it be Erwin's charge, Armin's final stand against the colossal titan, or the characters finally reaching Eren's basement, each episode just seemed to captivate me with at least one epic scene. And that's precisely where Attack on Titan truly shines: In its entertainment value. Maybe you're not a fan of the story, or perhaps you think that the characters are bland. But you can't deny that Attack on Titan is simply thrilling to watch. The excitement that I get out of watching this anime is unrivalled by practically any other show, and for me, that's what makes Attack on Titan truly special.",Season_3_Part_2
Roronoa,4,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"This season of Attack on Titan is known to be one of the best arcs of the whole series (is that really saying much though), but the ones who have decided that is none other than the manga readers. That is the one and only reason why it is rated so highly, especially after the snooze ride of a third season. I will give my opinion as an anime watcher only. I do not care what happens after, this is just my thoughts of the anime so far. MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story 4/10: The story is quite simple, our characters want to rebuild the Wall Maria, ... as a representation that humanity has a chance against the Titans. As another addition, we also have the mysterious basement that has been a question for many since the first season. Unless you still care for it even after 50 episodes, you will not be finding yourself anything worth your time. There is not much progression, and the anime uses inner monologue, and melodramatic statements of ""realism"" to its advantage, not letting anything happen just so that they are able to prolong the story further, despite being 10 episodes. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters 3/10: One of my biggest problems for me. Character development is VERY subtle, which I have seen others comment on. That is not good writing since it happens so suddenly with no actual commitment to making the character look interesting. Actual development should be clear, showing that the character has actually changed for good or bad. Why watch an anime where the characters are not standing out? The one that currently interested me is Erwin, he has one goal which he is basically willing to sacrifice all of his men to achieve. Eren and his gang of prepubescent children are not showcased for the most part, which can be a blessing for some, but it gives the feeling that there is no main character, no one to be focusing on. He still yells out stupidity with anger like ""Do not look down on me"", despite being towards the COLOSSAL titan. Does Sasha think it might be hilarious to yell out ""Pervert""? Armin seems to be the only one who actually tries to have a brain, but he is a wimp who will always be overthinking everything and will ask himself ""Why is everyone dying?"" while trying to figure out a plan. Who knows, but supposedly this is so realistic. When I said melodramatic earlier, I meant the creator of this show tries so hard for the characters to seem realistic, what do I mean by that? The soldiers, yes the ones that should already know that they are risking their lives, have the audacity to start crying their ass out while being attacked, they do not try to move or think for themselves. It is just an opportunity for Erwin to motivate them and seem like a badass. They will always be used as a shock factor, including Marco. He starts crying about ""talking it over"", when there's a broken window right beside him, did his legs just break or could he not move so that he would be able to at least try to run away? Nope, he has to be eaten in a brutal way. Characters also think if they yell out their thoughts and feelings, we the viewers, will automatically feel sorry for them. Reiner is the one that angers me the most, he is known to have a double personality, perfect for contradictions in the whole show. Using mental illness as an excuse is the last resort you should use in a character. You can make him indecisive, include his opinion on both sides, and that would work MUCH better. My friend has called him the ""Plot-Armored Titan"" and I don't have any doubts about that name. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Art 6/10: Not much to complain about here other than the atrocious CGI used in the colossal titan and horses, hopefully, there are a few glorious scenes (like Levi vs Kenny) upcoming. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sound 8/10: Perfectly fine, but it reuses the same OST for multiple scenes, losing its value for being a great tune. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoyment 3/10: I am currently enjoying it more than the second and third season because I am hoping for some crazy plot twists. So far though, it makes me glad I am only watching it weekly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall 4/10, TLDR: My only advice to you is to watch it if you have been a fan since Season 1, it has gradually lost quality despite the first one being Shounen as fuck, no excitement other than a few plot twists here and there. Thanks for reading this far.",Season_3_Part_2
mafd12,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"English isn't my native language, so you may find some redaction mistakes; anyway, I'll try to do my best in this review. - This review cointains spoilers - Early in the first season (I don't remember the exact episode), it was stated that the basement of the Yeagers house was pretty important, from that moment, throughout the show we have been given some hints about it's importance and how to get there seems to be vital for mankind; each time stronger, each time louder, there has been a lot of talk around it, more and more things pointed out toward this basement, and after two and a ... half seasons, they're finally there... or well, almost there. This (half) season begins with the Scouting Legion going to get back the Wall Maria, in a desperate effort, they go with everything they have against the titans inside the wall, the plan is to return to Shiganshina as fast as posible, there they'll stablish a cordon in order to defense the district, so Eren and company can get to the basement and reveal what has been the hope for mankind since the battle in Trost; simple in the theory, a huge chaos in the practice. Shingeki no Kyojin is know for its long battle sequences, taking a detailed look at the events and the impact that these have in the results of each fight; it seems that this whole (half) season will be like this: a long battle in which the fate of the humanity is put in danger again. One of the most attractive characteristics from this series is its dystopian setting, it's hard to imagine the world worst than how it already is, and eventually it get worst in some way: the titans destroy one of the walls, the titan are trying to destroy one wall more, there are titans infiltrated within the walls, everything has been product of a conspiracy, the titans seems to always have been humans transformed, etcetera; but there's always a hope element which contrast this hopeless atmosphere, most of the times being about Eren and his titan form, which finally helps to bring mankind some victories against their hunters, for a huge price, but something worthy of it. That narrative structure based on contrast is extremely strong here, the premise of the season is based on the idea that whatever be there it will be worthy of risking the strongest soldiers of humanity, that the benefit will be bigger than the cost, but at the end of the first episode this idea is diluted by the strategic movements of the titans, which makes seeming that everything has already been lost; this structure is repeated once and once again through these four episodes, but as it's used properly, it doesn't feel repetitive, it helps to emphasize the weigth of the plot in its stead, or well, till the moment in which Berthold appears and transforms in the Colossal Titan, from this point, the show takes a much more hopeless mood, the things are not going good for them and the chaos seems to have taken control of the situation, each step forward gets closer to be the latest; this reaffirm the setting of this as the most cruel (half) season of the show, where hope seems to disappear and the life of each member can't be guaranteed, where the fight will be for everything or nothing. Another attractive aspect from this (half) season is its focus on characters, the series has always been focused on how the characters decisions affect the story, giving itself the opportunity to explore their inner conflicts sometimes, this time it's balanced between this two approachments: it's showed how the actions they take move the story to one or other side, but it's also showed the convictions and motivations behind those actions, and how those are questioned in middle of all the chaotic situations; we have a more personal perspective of each character for comprehend better their emotional states and how they're led by them. In the technical side, Wit has maintained the quality standard we're used to see in this series, and althoguh the CGI Colossal Titan is pretty distracting, the art work is outstanding as ever. The work of the seiyuus is top-notch as we have seen through the other two and a half seasons; the music is still very good even if is not as epic as it was in previous seasons, it fits with each scene and provides them with more emotional power one piece at a time; but in the other hand we have the ending and the opening, which are a big step backward: the ending isn't bad, it's has a melancholic tone and it's mainly composed by piano, but the opening is like a missed mixture of the previous openings. It has been said till tiredness that this is the best arc from manga, that this will be revolutionary and that all the journey through the story is rewarded here; and I think those staying that are right, at least until this fourth episode, this (half) season seems to be a great climax built from all the previous arcs, it seems that this is the big bet of the show, and honestly, I'm really pleased with it.",Season_3_Part_2
Kuroko33,4,"Jul 4, 2019",0/0,"After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though? *This review will mention parts of season 1 and season 3. It will contain spoilers for the whole show* I remember the times when I was excited for a new Attack on Titan episode. There were problems back then too, sure, but I was able to enjoy it regardless. That is because for everything I watch there is a limit to the bs I can take. I know this is a review for season 3 part 2, but some ... problems are so big they can ruin the experience of watching the whole franchise. The last season of Game of Thrones is proof of that. So, what am I talking about? The first example is way back in season 1 when the show tricked us into thinking it was about the unlikely survival of humans vs giant mindless zombies. Then Eren turned into a titan and it turned into a standard shounen where the MC is special and has a hidden power. ""Ok, whatever, it could have been great, but I guess this is how it is now"" I said to myself as I accepted this new standard. The second example is in season 3 part 1 when they revealed that the reason people inside the walls don't know anything is the massive MIND WIPE made by some titan power or whatever. This is very lazy writing, only written because the author didn't know what to do with the cards he already layed out on the table. DO. NOT. MIX. MAGIC. AND. MYSTERY. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it's hard to do properly. Take death note for example, there is a magic notebook that kills anyone as long as you have their name. There were rules set at the start, and while new rules were added later it doesn't matter because the mystery only exists in the show. We, as the audience, know everything, the mystery is there for the characters. We get to watch them figure it out. Meanwhile, in AoT the story is constantly baiting you into getting curious about what happens next and then treating you like and idiot for not figuring out the new magic trick the author cooked up. To summarize this paragraph: in a mystery show, you shouldn't suddenly reveal crucial story elements to solve the riddles. Every plot element should be revealed early in the story and the viewer should have the chance to figure it out by gathering information laid out by the author or just make it an in-series mystery like Death note. That's how you make a good mystery. The reason I talked about all this is because it's very relevant to season 3 part 2. We finally got answers for what's in the basement, but at what cost? Surprisingly enough, all of the reveals make sense if you accept what has happened in season 3. As you already read in the last paragraph, I don't accept it. In spite of that, I will give props to the author for not making up even more BS on the reveal. However, the reveal itself was done in a lazy way with a flashback of 2 people sitting in a chair and info-dumping years of foreshadowing. Not to mention it's extremely convoluted, so much to a point that a friend who read the manga had to explain every detail of it for twenty minutes to me and my friends (who are anime-onlys) to understand it. Chalk it up to the three of us being stupid, but nobody got it right away. Additionally, memories can travel through time now and Eren gets memories handed to him when he touches Historia's hand. What a cheap way to reveal information, it's just more proof that magic has no place in a mystery show. The author can add whatever he feels like to the story and it doesn't need to make sense because it's magic. Not only are crucial elements of the mystery made up on the spot, other easily avoidable things are aswell. I will showcase a few examples: the hand-missile thingys used vs Reiner. They seem to be very effective at taking down the armored titan, but why weren't they used vs regular titans years prior? And why do they work in the first place when they clearly showed us in the 1st season that cannons have very little effect vs titans because of their regeneration powers? Going in melee range vs a titan seems like an inferior idea than to just blind-them with hand-missiles and then slice them. You can call it new technology, I call it convenient. Another convenient thing is the ""Titans can live for 13 years"" rule. I don't have a problem with the rule itself, just the way it was implemented. The author couldn't think of a natural way to justify Owl giving Grisha the titan power so he made it easy for himself and just made Owl die from the convenient curse. Furthermore, he didn't know what to do with the regular titans anymore so he just made them dissapear. Just like that, with one sentence. ""We cleared them all out in one year"" says Levi. I can't think of a more lazy way to do this. It's annoying to watch a show that tries to cut corners at every turn. The action in this show is bad. The strategies, the animation, the character power levels and the payoffs. Ok, maybe the animation isn't bad, it's just worse than season 1. There are noticable animation inconsistencies in almost every episode. Most of it is decent though, but we don't come to Attack on Titan for just decent animation, do we? At least it's not the disaster that was season 3 part 1, where they blew all the budget on one sakuga scene and then the rest of the season looked ass. Everybody knows about CGI colossal titan, so I won't spend any more time on this. The strategies are mega bad though, at least from the good guys. Let me start off with the positive, I like how the beast titan just stood far away, out of everybody's reach, throwing massive boulders. That was smart, he didn't put himself in danger, he didn't ""get cocky"" as anime villains tend to do. He even set up titans around the whole area so the good guys can't escape. Very smart play, bravo! The good guys, however, oh boy... So the plan is to jump from titan to titan to get to the main bad guy and solo him. Am I the only one that finds this 99% impossible and extremely idiotic? Not to mention they risked EVERYONE'S lives for this. Let me break down why everything is wrong with this: first off, the terrain. I remember in season 1 characters used to make comments about how they couldn't traverse an area because they didn't have any buildings to hook onto. Now that restriction is completely broken since apparently titans are a viable source of movement. If you hooked onto a titan before, you better hope you deal the killing blow or else you'd become a delicious snack. Instead of this, we have robot titans that stand in place and don't do a god damn thing even though they are SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HUMANS AND EASILY SPOT LEVI. They don't even have to fight him, they can just move out of the way and the whole plan is ruined. And what better way to present this than not to show it on screen at all... I'm not even being ironic here, there isn't any possible way to portray this scene without showing how flawed the strategy is. Realistically, even if somehow this whole situation didn't fail miserably, the beast titan could just see Levi jumping across the titans. I know they rode out and died just to cover levi with smoke, I only have a problem with the presentation of this scene. It looks like the soldiers shot smoke vertically in the air just to distract the titan and not to cover Levi. If this is really what they were going for, that makes the good guy strategy even more impossible than it already was, and the beast titan should get glasses. Pick your poison. The fights against armored and colossal titan were also a disaster. Reiner should have been killed several times. Apparently laying on the ground and covering your neck is a good idea, especially when the enemy displays their strong explosion weapons. And, of course, the good guys ""can't finish him off"" because using more explosions to blow up the rest of his head or hands is too much work. Furthermore, everybody prefers talking about killing reiner than actually killing him. This is another presentation problem, Reiner is on his knees with a blown up face and neck, but nobody does anything even though they could. You don't have to tell me it's better presented in the manga, because I believe you. About the colossal titan fight, we see another example of bad strategies. So their plan is: Armin jumps in like an idiot and distracts Bertholdt while Eren sneaks behind and surprises him. That's it. Question: why doesn't Bertholdt just squish or punch Armin and be done with it? Why does he start emitting steam to make himself vunerable when he's a 60 meter titan fighting a single human? Because of the plot, that's why. The ONLY reason the plan succeeded was because Bertholdt literally locked himself in place for no reason. Are you beginning to see a pattern here? Every time the good guys win, it is because the enemy made a mistake, therefore it feels cheap. Mistakes can happen, sure, but they shouldn't happen on a basic level. The mistake should be a flaw in someone's strategy and not, for example, forgetting to reload your weapon. On to the characters, most of them are the same as they were before. Bland and not really anything special. Eren used to be angry, saw the world black and white, ""Kill all titans!"" (a.k.a. a stereotype). Now he is more pathetic, whiny and blames everything on himself (a.k.a. a stereotype). He just shifted the most common MC personalities and he doesn't do anything. Most of his actions are directly controlled by the plot, he rarely reaches conclusions himself, and when he does, they are mostly worthless. Armin stopped being so whiny, which is always a plus. He is still, however, a pretty basic character. They tried to give him some significance by making him the leader, but this is meaningless since it keeps being forced onto him even though it looks like he doesn't want it. He did have the will to sacrifice himself, so he is a bit better than before. Mikasa is the worst one. All she ever does it cling onto f*cking Eren. Eren Eren Eren Eren, only Eren. None of the decisions are her own, she isn't even worthy of being called a character in my eyes. You would think she would mature over the years, but nope, always the same. It's a shame, since she could have been a great character. Now she is even worse than Asuna from SAO. Levi is the same, but more overpowered. The whole beast titan strategy wouldn't even work if levi wasn't so unreasonably strong. None of the other chacacters even come close. It would be fine if he was smarter than everyone else, but he has superhuman capabilties at this point. What he is able to do undermines the threat and fear of the titans. Erwin was my favorite character and he's dead now. He became very dumb before his death, thinking Armin is more valuable than himself for the purpose of survival. Either that, or he didn't want to become a titan, in which case I guess he didn't care about humanity after all. The plot armor: It didn't diminish, it multiplied. I hate it when every single conflict ends with a draw, and it's not only plaguing Attack on Titan, it's very common in many other anime. Even though I already talked about some, I will put all of the plot armor instances from these 10 episodes here in one place, just so it's easy to see how many there is. Reiner when he's on his knees. Why not finish him off? Because the plot still needs him. Armin when he's burned by the colossal titan. Why didn't he die? Because the plot needed him for the Eren vs Levi conflict scene. This also applies to Erwin for surviving that long with his wound, although it's not that big of a deal since it's much more believable. The beast titan when levi captured him. Why did he manage to escape? Because apparently smoke OP, it's totally impossible to hear that sneaky titan coming to save him! Let's forget that Levi has just solo killed like 50 titans AND beaten the beast titan. But Levi needs to not hear right now, because the plot still needs the beast titan to survive. Reiner. Again. Just like the beast titan, he got snatched by the fast one. And once again, impossible to hear him in a city full of crumbling houses. This was such an eye roll. I also hate it when every time they capture an enemy titan, instead of killing him, they want to ""question him"". This is fine from the characters perspective, however, every time they mention it, I instantly look around at who is going to save them. And lo and behold, they get saved every single time. Because of all this plot armor, the world starts to lack consequence and fights become meaningless. I didn't pay much attention to the sound, I just noticed it was misplaced sometimes. Animation and sound problems don't bother me usually, unless they are awful. The first time I heard the opening it sounded like a worse version of the first opening. Over time it grew on me and I see it has some differences that give it its own flavor. It's no SASAGEYO, but it's nice. In conclusion, Attack on Titan is a story with lots of minor and major problems. The author always puts himself in a corner and then introduces new elements in the same episode they are needed to get him out. Mysteries are resolved by magic tricks and asspulls. You can't even turn your brain off to enjoy the action because the strategies are extremely flawed any rely on enemies making basic mistakes. Characters never change in any meaningful way. The sound and animation are decent but not good enough for Attack on Titan standards. That's it, don't tell me that the manga is better because this is not a manga review, I'm rating the anime only.",Season_3_Part_2

Shingeki no Kyojin, or Shingeki no Kino as I like to call it, is what comes up when you combine kino art, with kino story, with kino music. This anime feels like it's been the work of Spielberg, Eastwood, Nolan and Tarantino combined. Story 10/10 As I've already caught up with chapter 117, I'm not gonna spoil this a lot. This season is about Erwin, Eren and Armin, really. Erwin coming to terms with his fate, Eren pushing forward, and Armin, well, you'll see. Eren continues his eternal quest for freedom and revenge, through ending his enemies, titan or human. You ... can not stop this testosterone fueled beast, this Titan of Freedom. He can not be stopped even if you'd like to stop him. That man sees one goal and one goal only, freedom, and no one is about to stop his from achieving it. A bit closer to freedom by every minute, chapter and episode. Art 10/10 WiT Studio gathered the best of the industry and told them ""I want kino on screens. Nothing but pure kino, perfect lines and perfect colors. I want to fear for my life when I watch Shingeki no Kino."" And they delivered. Sound 10/10 Hiroyuki ""The Sound of Kino"" Sawano is the man behind the greatness of this show, alongside Kaji and Isayama. YouSeeBigGirl, Call of Silence, and so many others elevate amazing moments to new heights. Linked Horizon is doing openings again. While the opinion is split on the newest opening, I have a firm one. Only an individual who read the manga, boasting an IQ of 130 and above can understand it's greatness. From the subtle hints of Marley, to the Shingashina Return spoilers, to the bits from every single opening depicting revenge, wings of freedom and fight, it's absolutely amazing. Voice Actors wise, we have Eren's VA, Kaji at the helm, which is so good, the writer of the manga based the character on him. Character 10/10 My favorite part. It's just believable. Kid lost a mother, friends and everything else because of titans. What's he gonna do? Make friends and use power of friendship? Understand the other side and create peace? Nope. The only solution is pure, 100% genocide. No kiddy shit, there is only one real choice. We watch this cast through perils, and rarely, happy moments. No cringy stuff like romance, so if you're looking for that, stick with whatever seasonal trash is airing currently. Enjoyment 10/10 It's hype. Pure hype. Unexpected, amazing, twists make sense. I don't want to spoil stuff, but man, you REALLY should be looking forward to the end of this arc, because this 10/10 anime turns into an 11/10 anime by the end.

Stark700,8,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. At its most fundamental level, Attack on Titan has been a ... show about survival, dark fantasy, and action-adventure filled with mystery that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Author Hajime Isayama’s work has achieved an international level success with over 90 million copies of the manga sold. Such an achievement is something few manga artists could ever reach. The franchise shares some similar elements in post-apocalyptic worlds such as Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Seraph of the End, God Eater, and among others. The real question fans should be asking themselves is if 10 episodes can be enough to make Attack on Titan stand out again as a blockbuster this year. To be fair, the Season 3's part 1 didn’t exactly earn its praise when we’re talking about pure action. There’s instead a lot of exposition and background storytelling of the past. From the start, Part 2 immediately builds off from the previous events and puts mankind to test. We got a homecoming of the main characters as they promise to take back what was there’s. The missions puts the characters’ lives at major risk considering the powers of their adversaries, specifically the Titan shifters. With enemies like Zeke, Reiner, and Bertholdt, there’s no doubt our heroes would have a mountain to climb. More so, this season also tests how much secrets they will discover. If you remember, there’s the secret basement that everyone is curious about. This season explores the dark secrets of what lies there and may draw a surprise or two out of you. In another way, Attack on Titan has an interesting pacing. We get a balanced amount of action, psychological drama, background storytelling, exposition, and characterization. The action itself is fast and furious with a heavy dose of psychology poured in during the missions. In several particular episodes, characters shows fear when they realize how fragile their lives are. A clear example is when the Beast Titan attacks the troops by throwing boulders like a rocket. Humanity takes heavy damage and some begins to even break down mentally. Another prominent example is Bertholdt this season who shows character change during the Battle of Shiganshina. His personality changes from a weak minded quiet person to a cold and determined individual. However, he still has traces of humanity left when we see his reactions in the past when Marco died or before moments of his own death. It’s what makes Attack on Titan feel so real times. The amount of human emotions that we see during characters’ final moments communicates the cruelty of their world. Isayama realized that he wanted the audience to experience and understand the world of Attack on Titan. It uses a clever device of extensive background storytelling through the eyes of important characters such as Eren’s father. Many anime that I’ve seen sometimes jumps all over the place and loses its direction. What makes Attack on Titan’s background storytelling works so well is how events tell more than a story. It has a meaningful purpose and always stays true to its themes. In addition, background storytelling reveals many secrets that the audience wants to see. If you’re an anime only viewer, this can be a thrill to see how much you’ve gotten right or wrong from previous theories. The characters from the past also holds important purpose for the overall flow of the plot. Make no mistake, Grisha Jaeger’s basement is like goldmine for Internet sleuths. What lies down there are unlocked secrets just waiting to be opened. And if you remember, character relationships in the show is ever so important since the beginning. From the day Eren, Mikasa, and Armin became close friends, they’ve always looked out after another. Because of relationships, character decisions also play a big role in certain outcomes. Without spoilers, I will say that a certain someone undergoes a huge change during the Battle of Shiganshina. Having seeing the amount of plot developments in this franchise, it may be easy to say that some events can be predictable. Perhaps they are but as a dark fantasy with survival themes, decisions often have huge plot outcomes that influences the past, present, and future. Attack on Titan’s character decisions and relationships remain adamant to not lose its importance. Even at 10 episodes, Attack on Titan continues to prove itself as one of the most iconic anime franchises of this generation. From a spellbinding story to an extravagant character cast, the show cleverly adapts with changes and development. Every episode is important that expands its overall themes and world fiction. Someday when this franchise ends, it will be history in the making. And I hope I’m there to see it.",Season_3_Part_2
Mobiletortoise,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the manga up to its most current chapter as of this review, but ... this review will be largely spoiler-free for both anime and manga viewers. Part 2 of season 3 is the culmination of everything that the previous seasons, over all these years, had been building up towards. The answers that the cast, and the viewers/readers had been (sometimes) patiently waiting for finally came to light. The origins of the titans, the battle for Shiganshina district, the basement, Eren's family, all of these reveals were foreshadowed absolutely perfectly by Isayama over his entire run on the manga and he somehow used the anime to fine tune those reveals even more so into the masterpiece presented here. The characters themselves are extremely well done by the VA's and Studio WiT, no one character is an afterthought. Traits, habits, facial expressions and personalities are exquisitely captured at the moment a character is on screen. No one eyebrow raise or smirk should be ignored. The seriousness of combat and massacre is engraved onto the faces and hearts of everyone involved, hysterics, escaping into themselves, or marching forward through the destruction they have witnessed. All the characters present are so incredibly well crafted that by the end of the season, we feel that they truly are HUMAN. Words honestly cannot describe how well done Sayano's OST has been for this season. Every piece was carefully selected, created, or remixed for particular scenes. The emotion evoked at even the final scene of the final episode is made 10 times more powerful by the incredible work done by the composer. An exemplary case of composition throughout the entire series, nothing more needs to be said. Part 1 of Season 3 left a high standard for many with it's streamlining of what many (Even the author himself) felt was the weakest part of the story. Between Studio WiT and Isayama they were able to raise the bar and create an excellent build up for one of the most anticipated arcs in the entire story. Somehow, someway, EVEN THOUGH I knew what would happen, the build up could not have prepared this reviewer for how well Part 2 was executed. Studio WiT has absolutely, without any doubt, created one of the greatest arcs in animation. I wish I could thank them and Isayama for giving this to us. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to have experienced from day 1. Now the real story can begin.",Season_3_Part_2
Crimson2OP,10,"May 20, 2019",0/0,"Personally, I believe the art, sounds and music of every SnK season were amazing. However, there were a few specific episodes/scenes in Part 1 that desperately lacked background music and weren't as immersive as in the previous episodes/seasons. Nevertheless, I still believe Part 1 was great although it would've been closer to a 10/10 with these small fixes. Season 1 was masterful, season 2 was great.. and so was Season 3 Part 1 (after rewatching the season and initially disliking the direction the story took, I believe I misjudged at first). Anyhow, while Part 2 didn't end yet.. It's amazing so far, chaotic and full of interesting points ... going for it. I hope they keep it up to make such a great series' continuation truly great because so far so good! :) Edit: Point still stands after finishing the season! :)",Season_3_Part_2
GazehH,10,"May 19, 2019",0/0,"From a long time i've been following this foro in multiple animes without an account, but today's episode was /'that'/ impresive. Honestly, i wasn't sure that they were going to pull off such a memorable episode. It's hard to make an episode to be able to capture a part of what it really may have felt 'the realizing of their certain death', the girl throwing up, that guy in total shock asking the obvious question 'are we gonna die?', the dispair is palpable. This Studio did it perfectly, the soundtrack chosen by them, the single tone, was perfect to make us feel the increasing stress in ... the air....Yes, palpable hopelessness, knowing bloody well they were going to die. Desperation, knowing that the more experienced and real  Survey Corps soldiers died in a single shot, and they are next. Erwin's motivation and such a conviction, ""we are all gonna die anyways, so give it a meaning, give everything in front of your dead comrades, because they gave everything as well for the livings"". Hell, fighting is the only way to rebel against the cruelty of this world eh? Erwin, well you certainly did it until the very end.",Season_3_Part_2
Foy,10,"May 28, 2019",0/0,"This is a review up till episode 5 of season 3 part 2. *Not really spoilers but I'm going to talk about episode in 5 in general without referring to scenes* Im sorry but after watching episode 5, you have to concede that despite all the general hype of the show and people talking down on it due to it becoming so mainstream, that this show is a godamn masterpiece. Episode 5 brilliantly manages to intertwine all the character's arcs leading up to this episode. Unlike shitty GOT, this show executes a climax to its peak potential rather than leaving the audience disappointed and expecting more. I know ... my review is mainly based around episode 5 but if you haven't watched the show, you really should, even if its just to be able to experience episode 5 to its fullest. As this acts as the zenith of what living up to its hype means. With the show masterfully get you to sympathize with all the characters, despite the moral ambiguities and flaws, you still root for the characters. And the animation perfectly supplements and further exemplifies the brilliance of the show through the fight choreography. Also I forgot to mention, f*** me, I'm by no means gay, but after episode 5 Levi is the closest thing I've had to getting a boner from a dude. In summary. Watch the show",Season_3_Part_2
Dukino,10,"Jun 30, 2019",0/0,"This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing ... a giant room in the other side. Heavy dose of perspective. It's not as simple as getting to the sea. There's so much more even beyond all we just saw. Took them a year since Trost and six since Bertholdt and Reiner blew that hole in the wall, along with the heaviest road anyone could walk down, to get those answers. This season has some incredible moments. The Return to Shinganshina arc is pretty much pure hype. So many emotional moments in that battle. Erwin going out like the boss he is, your soldiers absolutely rage and fight commander. His speech about the living carrying on the will of the dead and trusting those we leave behind to fulfill our dreams is iconic. The man knew how to inspire. Armin sacrificing himself, only to come right back but still, his stand against Bertholdt is godly. Holding on for them, so they could see the ocean. Levi with his slice and dice of Zeke then having to make that hard call between the two. Levi gone through so much to have to sit there and choose like that. Then to just get ridiculed by Flosch of all people. Spinless bastard. The basements secrets were the real treat of course. Humanity did not perish. Reading those words as I said before opens that door to a much bigger world. There's so much out there they don't know about. Eren finally tapping into his fathers memories opens even more. The plight of the Eldian people is a tragic one. Heavy symbolism to German Jews but used in a way that's sensitive to that pain too. Grisha's story rivals the main characters own in terms of just getting fucked over and over again. The man went through so much himself. Trying to use the Restorationists and Zeke ultimately blowing up in their face in such a cruel way. Zeke with his mother's lineage then connecting to Eren too. Grisha started this like Kruger said. His own speech on the wall deserving praise. You have to fight you have to get up and keep moving. Otherwise all the sacrifices people made for you would be for nothing. The actions we take have a cost, and they will get paid. It's our job to make sure they don't continue in the cycle of pain and suffering. It has to end. Speaking about the production for a second the beginning did look rough. Eren vs Reiner and through the first three or four episodes was iffy ngl. Some moments were like wha. But, that being said all the later big moments to me looked incredible. The visual imagery and the action scenes, especially the slice and dice, were jaw dropping in some cases. Simply outstanding stretch for the second half. They soundtrack of course soared. Sawano knows how to inject that stuff into you and its one I now listen to often. Overall this season was one as a manga reared I'd waited a while to see come to the screen and for a high majority I was not let down. So much has been answered and so many new questions raised. What Isayama did with this arc was completely flip Titan on its head. Took everything we've seen thus far and put it into it's true context. The venir has been lifted. They've reached the sea. The world is their enemy. Time to see what's beyond that sea. Final Season hype!!! It's gonna be a sight to behold. The last two arcs ramp up the reveals and the insanity and the spectacle of it while keeping those engaging questions and character moments. Going to be a long wait but once we get there, be ready. Despite and misgivings I may have this season is still the best to me. Titan has always been engaging narrative about humanity and survival but this arc brings to light the hidden meaning of it all. It's a true achievement in writing to be able to do something like this. 10/10.",Season_3_Part_2
Raptor97,10,"Jun 9, 2019",0/0,"The Basement guys... My head was never that mindfucked... (Story) RTS Arc is just perfect, end of story. The music is as always OUTSTANDING. Character development is cleary noticable and very well written. Especially Mikasa and her Squad. What I also really like are the flash backs and also how the scenes are switching, pure professional work there. ... Enjoyment is cleary the best its just epic to watch this whole show. The animations are by far one of the best (best example episode 17) And japanese voice actors were on their very best in episode 18, its just unbelievable. In my opinion the best series ever made.",Season_3_Part_2
Sumirerireri,6,"Jul 1, 2019",0/0,"I don't like writing negative reviews, and before I start I have to say that I gave this a positive average score. However, not everybody think that Snk is the best thing out there, and I feel it's necessary to give voice to ""other"" opinions too. Mine, in this case. The show is nice. The animation is good and it's very entertaining. I'll give it that. However it has a lot of flaws, and this season, while it's in some aspects more interesting than the previous ones, it's also lacking a bit. My biggest probleme with this anime is more of an adaptation issue. ... I may criticise some aspects of the story itself, but what I find specially disappointing is the narrative structure of the animation. The narration style tries to make the plot more mysterious by giving small fragments of information here and there instead of going for the big punctual revelations, and that's supposed to be original, but the truth is that once you start to put all the pieces together, it feels like they are doing it so they can hide the weaknesses of the plot. When you put the pieces together, you can see that the story has many incoherences. During the previous seasons I expected those incoherences to be fixed with deep and surprising answers, but as the show progresses, the answers never seem to come, and when they do, they are always partial and disconnected. Basic narrative rule: If your plot is lacking something (as it seems to be the case) at least try to compensate it with a good hype. First mistake: Fragmenting the revelations is the death of hype. In this season, now that we know more about what is going on, we can see that the story is not that deep, and the reasons behind the action are not that plausible, maybe because, at a psychological level, the characters are not fully developed either. Their personalities are very basic and random, they don't learn or evolve, and so their actions are lacking of meaningful purpose. When watching this show, I always feel like something huge and awesome is going to happen right around the corner, but it never actually does. All the supposed important information the main characters have gotten and all they have achieved... truth is, I don't care... They drop a plot twist about a random character that has had almost no screen time at all until then. How are we supposed to get effectively empathetic with characters we don't know? Basic narrative rule number two: When you drop a bomb about something, make sure your public actually knows something about that, otherwise the impact will be completely pointless. That happens when the distribution of information is poorly done. Besides, for a show that relies so strongly on the ""emotions of the sacrifices made in war"" most of the conversations are pretty empty and lacking deep insight of human emotions. They use so many words to give so little information. The characters almost never say anything that may help to grasp their personality or the basis of their actions any better. Even when they talk about something important, they never let the conversation completely flow towards what the audience actually needs to hear in order to empathize or be effectively amazed by the plot twists, and while that's a narrative resource that can be nice to use now and then to create intrigue, it's almost impossible to build 3 seasons systematically using that resource. This might not be a problem for people who already read the manga, but it may make it frustrating for someone who hasn't. I guess it might work if you are watching it merely for the action. The story almost never stops, they are always on the move and there's always something going on, so it's overall entertaining, even though at a deeper level it has flaws. I've watched it because honestly, it's very easy to watch, but I think for a full experience with the story, it might be a better idea to read the manga. Again, this is my personal opinion and it's ok if you watch the show and think otherwise. I respect that. But just know that not everybody thinks that this is the ultimate show and that's to be respected as well.",Season_3_Part_2
Sahil_K_Chandio,10,"Jun 5, 2019",0/0,"Attack on Titan season 3 part 2 is simply perfect in every way! It has an awesome opening song, like I am very thankful that we have Linked Horizon performing the opening song again they really killed it with this new opening song they made. They teased awesome stuff and hell in this season we have absolute awesome moments regarding characters like Levi and others. I reckon this season is going to end with the basement secret being revealed. I am out of words to describe this ineffable season Attack on Titan just keeps getting so much better and better with each new season.
